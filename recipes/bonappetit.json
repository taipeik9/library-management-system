    "title": "Cold Noodles With Tomatoes and Peanut Sauce",
    "description": "Summer food is a very particular quandary: some of the best produce of the year, during arguably the worst cooking season (too hot, too stuffy, too sweaty). The no-cook route is great, paved with salads and stone fruits aplenty, but it’s when you find yourself on the internet searching, “How many nights in a row can I eat watermelon for dinner?” that you know things have gone too far. Consider this chilled noodle salad for such times. The cooking, if you can call it that, is limited to boiling a pot of noodles. (Resist the urge to cook them al dente, as you would pasta. Chilled noodle salads benefit from well-done noodles.) The sauce involves grating tomatoes—summer’s most ephemeral joy—into a bowl and whisking in creamy peanut butter and a series of fridge-door condiments. The end result is a refreshingly tangy and spicy dinner.",
    "ingredients": [
      "8–9 oz. dried udon noodles or spaghetti",
      "12 Vegetable oil (for noodles)",
      "⅓ oz. ripe beefsteak or heirloom tomatoes (1–2 large)",
      "¼ cup creamy peanut butter",
      "¼ cup apple cider vinegar",
      "3 cup chili crisp",
      "4 Tbsp. soy sauce",
      "4 tsp. sugar",
      "⅓ oz. cherry tomatoes, halved, quartered if large",
      "⅓ cup salted roasted peanuts, preferably cocktail"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Cook 8–9 oz. dried udon noodles or spaghetti in a medium pot of boiling salted water 1 minute longer than package directions. Drain noodles in a colander and rinse under cool running water. Drizzle with a bit of vegetable oil (about 1 tsp.; this will keep the noodles from sticking) and toss to coat. Set noodles aside.",
      "Meanwhile, slice a thin round off the bottoms of 12 oz. ripe beefsteak or heirloom tomatoes (1–2 large). Starting at cut end, grate tomatoes on the largest holes of a box grater over a large bowl until all that’s left is the flattened tomato skin and stem; discard. Add ⅓ cup creamy peanut butter, ¼ cup apple cider vinegar, ¼ cup chili crisp, 3 Tbsp. soy sauce, and 4 tsp. sugar and whisk vigorously until sauce is smooth and emulsified.",
      "Add 4 oz. cherry tomatoes, halved, quartered if large, and reserved noodles to sauce and toss until well coated.",
      "Arrange noodle salad on a platter and top with ⅓ cup salted roasted peanuts, preferably cocktail, and ⅓ cup store-bought fried shallots. Scatter thinly sliced scallions and coarsely chopped cilantro over."

    "title": "One-Bottle Vermouth Sangria",
    "description": "Sweet vermouth is a cheat code for quick sangria. This cocktail staple is a ready-made combination of the classic Spanish pitcher drink’s principle ingredients—wine, spirits, and sugar—and it has already been infused with deep, complex flavor by the pros. All you need is to pour it in a pitcher and add a squeeze of fresh citrus juice, some chilled club soda or seltzer for fizz, and the ripest summer fruit you can get your hands on—pull from a flat of berries or throw in a fragrant peach or nectarine. Add more lemon or seltzer to taste as needed; different vermouths vary in sweetness.This is the kind of easy pitcher drink you can mix up just about anywhere, even the cramped galley kitchen of your vacation rental. (You swear it looked SO much nicer in the listing.) Feel free to batch it up in the morning—just hold off on adding the club soda and ice until just before serving. This effortless sangria recipe will work with any sweet vermouth you’re able to find—just make sure it’s not the bottle you opened last summer. Stocking up? We like vanilla-scented Carpano Antica and warmly spiced Foro Rosso here. If you like things a little stronger and more spritz-like, use a dry sparkling wine like Cava in place of the seltzer.",
    "ingredients": [
      "8 oz. fresh or frozen fruit (such as cherries, raspberries, blackberries,  and/or sliced peaches)",
      "1 375-ml bottle sweet vermouth (such  as Carpano Antica)",
      "½ cup (or more) fresh lemon juice",
      "½ cup fresh orange juice",
      "1½ cups (or more) chilled club soda"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Gently stir 8 oz. fresh or frozen fruit (such as cherries, raspberries, blackberries, and/or sliced peaches), one 375-ml bottle sweet vermouth, ½ cup fresh lemon juice, and ½ cup fresh orange juice in a large pitcher to combine. Add ice to fill pitcher and pour in 1½ cups chilled club soda. Taste sangria and add more lemon juice or club soda if needed.",
      "Do Ahead: Sangria (without ice and club soda) can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Add ice and club soda just before serving."

    "title": "Ginger Beer and Mustard Pork Chops",
    "description": "We love quick-cooking, thin-cut boneless pork chops, but they can often skew dry. Not here. When marinated in a simple blend of Dijon mustard, honey, garlic, and ginger beer, the lean cut becomes remarkably tender and bursting with spicy-sweet flavor, all thanks to that latter ingredient. Though ginger beer may seem like an unexpected addition, its acidity and sugary sweetness make it an ideal marinade, breaking down tough muscle fibers and glazing it in a thick, glossy coating. (Don’t confuse ginger beer for ginger ale, though; the latter is too sweet for this marinade.) Served with a peppery arugula and sliced shallots, these pork chops are the ideal low-effort, high-reward recipe.",
    "ingredients": [
      "10 garlic cloves, finely grated",
      "1 cup Dijon mustard",
      "1 cup honey",
      "¾ cup ginger beer",

    "steps": [
      "Mix together 10 garlic cloves, finely grated, 1 cup Dijon mustard, 1 cup honey, ¾ cup ginger beer, 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and 1 Tbsp. freshly ground pepper in a 1-gal. resealable plastic bag or large baking dish. Add 1½ lb. boneless center-cut pork chops (¼\"–½\" thick; about 10) to marinade and turn to coat. Seal or cover; chill, turning occasionally, at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.",
      "Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; oil grate with vegetable oil. Remove pork chops from marinade, letting excess drip back into bag or dish; discard marinade. Grill pork chops, turning halfway through, until charred and cooked through, about 4 minutes total. Transfer to a baking sheet and let rest 5 minutes.",
      "Scatter ½ cup (lightly packed) baby arugula and ½ small shallot, thinly sliced, over a platter. Drizzle with some extra-virgin olive oil and season with flaky sea salt and pepper.

    "title": "Skillet Blueberry Cobbler",
    "description": "My requirements for a summer dessert are (A) that fruit feature prominently and (B) that it mostly serves as a vehicle for a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This easy blueberry cobbler recipe checks both boxes, with the added benefits of a very short ingredient list and super quick assembly (we’re talking 10 minutes prep time, max—blueberry pie could never).Fresh blueberries are particularly well-suited among summer’s best fruits to cobbler-fy. (They maintain slightly more texture than the filling of a raspberry, blackberry, or peach cobbler does.) But you can swap in frozen blueberries if that’s what you’ve got. Whether oversized and gem-like or wild, tiny, and tart, they’ll shine in this recipe that—speaking from experience—you just might memorize without even trying.Spreading the simple batter into a skillet full of melted butter might seem strange, but the combination creates crisp, buttery edges that puff up around the bubbling hot fruit, transforming into the cakey cobbler topping. Eat this dessert warm from a shallow large bowl, topped with a melting scoop of store-bought ice cream, for the best combination of flavors you’ll eat all summer. Refrigerate leftovers in an air-tight container for up to 3 days; reheat in short bursts in a microwave, or eat cold straight from the storage vessel.",
    "ingredients": [
      "10 oz. fresh or frozen blueberries (about 2 cups blueberries)",
      "3 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice",

      "Melt ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter in a 10\" cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Remove pan from heat; scrape in batter. Spread into an even layer as much as possible (the butter will ooze over batter and pool at the sides). Spoon blueberry mixture, including any juices, over batter. Bake cobbler in oven until cake is golden brown and berries are juicy, 45–50 minutes.",

    "title": "Sprite-Grilled Chicken Skewers",
    "description": "These grilled chicken skewers are flavorful, spicy, and full of citrusy pep, all without having to juice a lemon. The secret ingredient? Sprite. I took a note from chicken inasal, a Filipino barbecued chicken dish, and marinated the chicken breasts in the lemon-lime soda along with fish sauce, garlic, and Thai chili sauce to tenderize the meat and infuse it with punchy flavor. The result is succulent, spicy, sweet-sticky chicken skewers. Bonus: You can use up any half-empty bottles of Sprite for this marinade (you don’t need the fizz).",

    "title": "Slow-Cooker Peanut Butter Chicken",
    "description": "The benefit of a slow cooker is that it does almost all the work for you, so why not lean in? In this kid-friendly recipe, peanut butter (use the standard stuff, like Skippy or Jif, rather than a “natural” variety, for best results) thickens and flavors a simple sauce for delightfully tender boneless, skinless chicken thighs. A big squeeze of lime juice to finish this rich, nutty dish is crucial for balance and bite, while thinly sliced scallions and jalapeños add some freshness and crunch. Pro tip: For a totally hands-off meal, enlist your rice cooker to make the side.",

    "description": "A well defined–but not burnt–char is the difference between decent steak and restaurant-quality results. Two ordinary but unexpected pantry ingredients work together to guarantee a dark, sticky-sweet crust on these steaks, so deeply impressive your guests may badger you to open your own bistro, “just a tiny space that seats 10.” (Do not succumb.) Mayo, with its mix of fat and protein (oil, eggs) reinforces meat's natural Maillard browning while the fructose in honey caramelizes readily over the heat of the grill. Brushed on in thin layers as the steaks are flipped, the duo forms a deeply bronzed patina on the surface, full of smoky flavor and in bold contrast to the rosy medium-rare interior.Turn the steaks frequently–about every minute–so they cook evenly with the best chance at building a crust.",

Just like with burgers, you can set out buns, condiments, and a bevy of toppings for people to build their own sandwiches to their exact specifications. The only real cooking required from you is forming and flipping patties, here made from ground pork and a few flavorful pantry staples like soy sauce and fish sauce. Don’t hold back on the quick-pickled vegetables—they provide some welcome acidity and crunch against the juicy pork and slick of mayonnaise. Use any buns or rolls here, from standard burger buns to kaiser rolls to flour-dusted ciabatta.",

While it’s impossible to improve on the flavor of berries with just a little sugar and a touch of lemon, I’ve always felt underwhelmed by the dish as a whole. For me, there’s too much shortcake and not enough saucy fruit to make up more than one or two perfect bites. So I developed this recipe, swapping out shortcakes for choux buns, which bake up hollow instead of dense and doughy. Tear the buns open and fill them with all those glorious berries and sweet cream.",

      "Do Ahead: Strawberries can be macerated 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.",

(105 g) water to a boil in a medium saucepan, stirring with a wooden spoon to encourage butter to melt and salt and sugar to dissolve. Immediately reduce heat to medium-low and add ½ cup (63 g) all-purpose flour all at once. Stir gently until most of the flour is absorbed, then cook, stirring vigorously and breaking up pockets of flour as needed, until a thin film forms on bottom and sides of pan and dough comes together into a single mass, 2–3 minutes. (The dough should look glossy and feel buttery-slick to the touch.) Transfer dough to a small bowl and spread up the sides with spoon (this will encourage it to cool faster). Let sit until cooled slightly but still warm to the touch, about 4 minutes.",

Using a fork, mix until incorporated, then add remaining 1 large egg, room temperature, beaten to blend, and mix again to combine. Using a rubber spatula, scrape any dough from fork, then vigorously mix dough with spatula until very smooth, glossy, and a little stretchy (when you lift the spatula out of the dough, the dough falling off the end should form a V shape).",

(It’s important not to open the oven door at any point during this time—you need all that trapped heat and steam to create light-as-air choux cakes.)",
      "Crack oven door open and check choux cakes; if they still look pale, continue to bake until golden brown, 2–5 minutes more. Transfer to a wire rack; immediately poke a small hole into the bottom of each choux cake with a skewer, chopstick, or paring knife to let the steam escape. Let cool, right side up.",
      "Meanwhile, whisk 1 cup heavy cream and 1 tsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract in a clean small bowl until firm peaks form. Cover and chill until ready to use.",
      "To serve, using a serrated knife, gently slice choux cakes in half through the equator and arrange bottom halves on plates. Spoon strawberries along with any juices at the bottom of the bowl over each choux cake bottom, dividing evenly. Scoop some whipped cream on top of strawberries and close up choux cakes.",

    "title": "Sri Lankan–Style Black Pork Curry",
    "description": "This take on a classic Sri Lankan curry is particularly unique due to its use of black pepper, which has a slow-building heat that creeps up on you. Black pepper doesn’t contain capsaicin, the substance responsible for chiles’ spiciness; instead it possesses a compound called piperine that gives it a warming intensity. (Peppercorns tend to lose their pungency over time, so consider cracking open a fresh jar for this recipe.)

    "title": "Paneer Kathi Rolls",
    "description": "Whenever I was tight on time in college (but plenty hungry), you’d likely find me at a nearby street vendor, awaiting my turn at one of their paneer kathi rolls. Despite the plethora of options, this popular Indian street food, also known as Paneer Frankie, was always my go-to: Creamy paneer cubes, bell peppers, and sliced onions, draped in a tangy, spiced yogurt marinade, and stuffed into flaky paratha, ready to eat streetside or cart along to my next lecture.To recreate my favorite paneer kathi roll recipe at home, I had to sidestep the roti, which isn’t available in my local grocer; large flour tortillas make a worthwhile stand-in, but if you can find frozen parathas, feel free to use them. Other than the change in flatbread, these kathi rolls are quite traditional. Kashmiri is a bright red chili powder used frequently in India to add color to dishes. It isn’t particularly hot, but it does bring a certain warmth—if you can’t find it, use paprika instead.Making the explosively flavorful paneer filling couldn’t be simpler: Toss the cheese and veggies in a mixing bowl with spiced yogurt, scrape the marinated paneer and friends into a sauté pan, and cook until the vegetables are tender. Pile onto tortillas with a garnish of chaat masala and fresh cilantro then—here’s the important part—sear the wrapped tortillas so they get golden and crispy on the outside. Serve with green chutney (this one made with green chiles and coconut is particularly nice, but a store-bought version is fine) for dunking or spooning over each bite. If you want to take them to the park, the beach, or to your next class, wrap them first in parchment, then in foil to keep all the goodness tucked inside.",

    "title": "Spicy Beef Noodle Soup With Mushrooms",
    "description": "This spicy beef noodle soup recipe has a special skill you might not expect: It has the power to cool you down. Similar to iconic dishes like Vietnamese bún bò huế and bún riêu, which are frequently eaten on the hottest days of the year, the soup combines chile heat (in the form of a savory jam flavored with lemongrass and garlic) and temperature heat. The two types of heat work in tandem to increase sweat, which in turn brings down your body temperature.For long-simmered flavor without the long cook time, start with store-bought broth (or homemade broth if you’re feeling extra ambitious) and reinforce it with aromatics including green onions, garlic, ginger, and fish sauce. Ask your butcher for shaved beef (any cut works, but we recommend brisket, sirloin, beef shank, or beef chuck). You’ll ladle the hot broth over the raw meat, which will just cook it through. Again, if you're the DIY type, you can chill a larger cut of beef in the freezer for 30 to 60 minutes, then use your sharpest knife to cut the meat into thin slices.Tiny tender mushrooms add a bit more umami, but you can take some liberties: Poach sliced fennel or halves of baby bok choy in the broth until tender. Swap out the beef for pork belly or butterflied shrimp. Trade the rice noodles and meat for store-bought frozen dumplings. Whichever way you go, complete the picture with crunchy bean sprouts, cooling fresh cilantro, and invigorating lime juice, and bring the chile jam to the table so diners can garnish to their tolerance level.",

    "title": "Miracle Cabbage Stir-Fry",
    "description": "Chinese home cooking is full of vegetarian fare that requires a quick toss in a hot wok, just like this sweet, savory, and slightly tart cabbage stir-fry. Green cabbage retains its crunch, while earthy black vinegar—a must-get for this recipe and a pantry all-star for those who love Chinese cooking—does the heavy lifting for flavor.Chinese cabbage stir-fry is best-known in the US as a Sichuanese dish, packed with heat and tingle. But this is a simpler, more pared down version that my mother cooked for me shortly after I gave birth to my daughter, when I desperately needed fiber to deal with postpartum constipation. Though my pregnancy acid reflux had tamed, I needed a dish I could eat over and over again without overwhelming my digestive system.If you’re not nursing a tender tummy, feel free to increase the number of chiles, and/or add crushed garlic along with it. The high-heat technique means it cooks in less than 10 minutes, so even if you’re not in need of more fiber, this cabbage is ready to be a weeknight staple. Eat it with white rice.Stir-fries depend on a wide cooking surface and constant high heat to guarantee charred edges and a crunchy-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside texture. If you find that your cabbage is turning brown too quickly, lower the heat accordingly.",

    "title": "Grilled Porterhouse Steak With Parmesan Butter",
    "description": "You don’t have to head out to your favorite American steakhouse for a great porterhouse steak, but you do need to listen up—especially if it’s your first time cooking one. The porterhouse (not to be confused with the smaller T-bone steak) is a big piece of meat from the short loin end of a cow. It sports two different cuts of meat on either side of the T-shaped bone—a New York strip steak and a tenderloin.The strip has a good amount of marbling, so it’s easier to manage, while the tenderloin is leaner and more prone to overcooking. The time spent in the marinade helps, but that doesn’t mean you should slap the steak on the grill over high heat and walk away. Go with medium heat and check on the steak as it cooks, moving it to a cooler edge of the grill if it’s burning. We’ve offered both cook times and internal temperatures in the recipe so you can be sure you will end up with a perfect steak. If you’re working without a grill, sear the porterhouse on your stovetop using a large cast-iron skillet and flipping the meat frequently—just be sure to turn on the exhaust and open a window; things can get smoky.Meanwhile, the paprika-Parmesan butter gives the juicy steak a turbo boost, complementing its beefy flavor with spicy, umami richness. Serve with a crunchy iceberg salad and a nice bottle of chilled red wine.",
    "ingredients": [
      "¼ cup olive oil",
      "7 garlic cloves, finely grated on a Microplane",
      "1 Tbsp. finely chopped fresh thyme leaves",
      "1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal salt or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "2½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper, divided",
      "1 tsp. finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves",
      "1 (2 lb.) porterhouse steak (about 2\" thick), preferably prime or as well-marbled as you can find",
      "6 Vegetable oil (for grill)",
      "1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature",
      "2 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. finely grated Parmesan cheese",
      "2 drained anchovy fillets, finely chopped",
      "1 tsp. paprika (sweet or hot)",
      "1 tsp. Dijon mustard",
      "½ tsp. Worcestershire sauce"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Combine ¼ cup olive oil, 7 garlic cloves, minced or finely grated, 1 Tbsp. finely chopped fresh thyme leaves, 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal salt or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper and 1 tsp. finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves in a 1-gal. resealable plastic bag or glass or ceramic baking dish. Add one 2 lb. porterhouse steak (about 2\" thick) and turn to coat in marinade. Cover (or seal) and refrigerate, turning occasionally, at least 2 hours and up to overnight.",
      "Prepare a grill for high indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off); oil grate with vegetable oil. Remove steak from marinade, letting excess drip back into dish (or bag); discard marinade. Grill over direct heat, keeping tenderloin (the smaller side) away from the most intense heat and turning steak about every minute or so to control flare-ups and ensure even browning, until deeply browned on all sides (including standing it on its side with tongs to render and brown fat around edges), 6–8 minutes. Move steak over indirect heat (still positioning tenderloin side away from the heat) and grill, turning every 1–2 minutes and moving closer to or farther away from heat as needed to build even color, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of steak registers 120° for medium-rare, 10–12 minutes, or longer for your desired doneness. Transfer to a wire rack set over a rimmed baking sheet and let rest 15–30 minutes.",
      "As the steak is resting, mix together 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature, 1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. finely grated Parmesan cheese, 2 drained anchovy fillets, minced, 2 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. Dijon mustard, 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce, remaining ½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper, and ½ tsp. hot sauce in a small bowl until well combined. Using sharp knife, cut meat away from bone. Cut each meat section into ⅓\"-thick slices. Spread butter over top of slices and serve.",
      "Do Ahead: Parmesan butter can be made up to 2 days in advance and stored in an airtight container in the fridge. When ready to serve, bring to room temperature.",

    "title": "Tuna Niçoise Salad",
    "description": "Nothing says “I’m on vacation” like a meal that lets you linger over a glass of rosé, imagining you’re looking out at the sea. This classic niçoise salad recipe delivers big, briny French Mediterranean–inspired flavors with lots of satisfying crunch. Bonus: It requires the bare minimum of prep time, so it won’t eat into your dozing-off-with-a-book-in-your-lap plan for the day.Just a handful of quality ingredients make this summer salad special. Canned tuna plays the leading role, so splurge on a really good tin—after all, you’re on vacation (or at least dreaming about it). For the briny elements, choose your own adventure. Tiny niçoise olives are traditional, but meaty green Castelvetranos or robust black olives like Kalamata work too. Capers make another great addition, and they’re even better when you crisp them up. Peperoncini bring both tang and a touch of heat. Just drain whatever you choose and pat dry on paper towels so you don’t sog out the dressing. Look for impeccable produce at the farmers market: fresh green beans or haricots verts, spring’s first potatoes, and crisp radishes and cucumbers. We’ve skipped the greens, but no one will object if you want to add a bed of Little Gem or butter lettuce leaves.To keep everything simple, cook each element in a single pot in a particular order. First, boil the eggs, then blanch the green beans, and, finally, boil the potatoes. Have ready a bowl of ice-cold water to chill the ingredients quickly. Use the cooking time to assemble the dressing and other elements. When ready, drizzle a lemon vinaigrette over the composed salad, slice some crusty bread, and pour that rosé. No garnish is necessary, but if you have some fresh basil on hand, don’t let it go to waste.",

    "title": "Crab Cake Sandwiches",
    "description": "Becoming this lofty, flavorful crab cake sandwich is the ultimate dream for any young seafood puck. If you were a crispy Maryland-style crab cake, cradled between swooshes of Old Bay–spiked tartar sauce and squished cozily inside a toasted brioche bun, you’d be pretty happy too.Various styles of prepared crab meat are available refrigerated or frozen in the seafood section of most grocery stores; whatever you find within your budget (jumbo lump crabmeat, claw meat, blue crab, etc.) will work. We swapped in panko breadcrumbs for the usual Italian-style ones, which keeps the crab cakes from getting dense or stodgy. We also kept the seasoning light to keep the focus on the sweet crabmeat, but if you’re craving heat, a few dashes of hot sauce wouldn’t hurt anything.To cut down on prep time, we relied on precut slaw mix (though you can, of course, make your own coleslaw if desired). Assemble the slaw before you start working on the crab so that the cabbage has time to soften before piling onto the sandwiches. Apple cider vinegar brings the tang to this slaw, but if you’ve got a lemon, you can grate the lemon zest into the crab cakes and use the lemon juice in the slaw for an extra hit of brightness.",

    "title": "Buttermilk Fried Chicken",
    "description": "This Southern fried chicken recipe relies on a spiced brown sugar brine, an egg-enriched buttermilk dredge, and a double coating of flour (first plain, then in a blend amped up with cornstarch and spices). The result is juicy chicken with extra-crispy, golden brown skin that’ll please even the pickiest eaters. The recipe comes from the now closed Buxton Hall in Asheville, North Carolina, one of our Best New Restaurants, 2016.To save a few bucks at the market, buy a whole chicken and cut it into parts yourself (two thighs, two breasts, two wings, and two drumsticks). If you have a deep fryer, now’s the time to pull it out; if not, a large pot with a heavy bottom will do. If you’re going the second route, you’ll need a deep-fry thermometer to monitor the oil, and either way you’ll want a meat thermometer to ensure the chicken pieces reach their ideal internal temperature. An apron and a long-sleeve shirt are also handy to protect you from hot oil spatters.If it’s your first time making fried chicken, be sure to map out your time. The chicken needs to marinate for at least 8 hours, but is even better when given a full day. You’ll also notice we recommend a higher final temperature for dark meat (the chicken thighs and drumsticks) than we do for white meat (the chicken breasts and wings). The higher temp gives the connective tissues in the dark meat time to break down, resulting in the best fried chicken ever with the tenderest meat possible. Serve with tangy mayo-based white barbecue sauce, sweet bread and butter pickles, and plenty of paper towels.Looking for heat?

    "title": "Manhattan",
    "description": "A classic Manhattan cocktail recipe doesn’t have much to it—and it shouldn’t. It’s a straightforward, no-nonsense, old-school drink that’s two parts whiskey, one part vermouth, and a few dashes of aromatic bitters. But that wasn’t always the case. “The first recipes, which appeared in books in 1884, called for equal parts whiskey and vermouth. Some formulas actually called for more vermouth than whiskey,” explains Robert Simonson in The Encyclopedia of Cocktails. Oh, and the story you might have heard about the drink being invented at an event hosted by Winston Churchill’s mother in New York City at the Manhattan Club “has been thoroughly debunked,” he adds.Both Canadian and American rye whiskey are acceptable here, as is bourbon—swap in scotch and it’s a Rob Roy. Balance it with a sweet red vermouth like Carpano Antica Formula or Cocchi di Torino. (A perfect Manhattan, meanwhile, splits the second measure, using both sweet and dry vermouth—try it sometime.) Feel free to play with the ratios to find your ideal version, but note that if your bottle of vermouth has been open in the fridge (yes, in the fridge) for more than a few months, it might be time to replace it.Don’t worry if you don’t have a proper cocktail shaker; since this drink recipe calls for stirring, any mixing glass or jar will do just fine. Use a high-quality cocktail cherry for the garnish (we like high-quality Hotel Starlino Maraschino Cherries or Luxardo cherries), or skip the fruit in favor of an orange or lemon peel.",
    "ingredients": [
      "3 oz. rye whiskey",
      "1½ oz. sweet vermouth",
      "2 dashes Angostura bitters or orange bitters",
      "1 maraschino cherry or 1 wide strip of orange peel (for garnish)"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Combine 3 oz. rye whiskey, 1½ oz. sweet vermouth, and 2 dashes Angostura bitters or orange bitters in a cocktail shaker filled with ice cubes. Stir gently to chill, about 30 seconds, and strain into a coupe or martini glass. Garnish with 1 maraschino cherry or twist 1 wide strip of orange peel over the glass to express its oils and drop the peel into the glass.",

    "title": "Very Good Vegan Tacos",
    "description": "These easy vegan tacos from our Feel Good Food Plan are startlingly satisfying, all thanks to one underrated ingredient—soy curls. Elusive in stores but available online (with thousands of glowing reviews), this plant-based protein is made solely from soybeans, just like tofu. But unlike tofu, which is perishable, soy curls are shelf-stable. That means you can keep them in the pantry and always be minutes away from a budget-friendly, fiber-rich meal. (They’re also gluten-free if that’s a hurdle for you with seitan.) I was led to this product by BA alum Sarah Jampel (who calls them her “go-to meat substitute”) and cookbook author Gena Hamshaw (who raves about them in her cookbook The Vegan Week). It took me only one bite to start buying them in bulk.I won’t sugarcoat it: In the package, soy curls are not cute. When I brought them into the test kitchen, some of my coworkers even wondered if they were edible. But after a swift soak in broth, the dehydrated curls plump into tender pieces, like shredded rotisserie chicken. Sauté these on the stovetop until crispy and golden, and you get something even carnivores can’t resist. Test kitchen editor Kendra Vaculin immediately ordered eight bags. Senior test kitchen editor Shilpa Uskokovic dubbed herself “an instant convert.” With this humble ingredient, infinite vegan or vegetarian meals await. Roll them into a wrap, sprinkle them atop a salad, toss them into a stir-fry, or my favorite, turn them into tacos.While the soy curls are hydrating for the taco filling, you can use that prep time to work on whatever toppings you’d like. A colorful salsa is a must in my book, but let the veggies at the market (or in your fridge) lead the way. Mango Salsa is wonderful here, or riff on that template with a juicy peach or nectarine. You could also opt for Pico de Gallo, Salsa Verde, or one of my all-time favorites, Salsa Guille. I like to load up my tacos with avocado slices, radish slices, cilantro, and dairy-free sour cream. But guacamole, cabbage slaw, or pickled red onion or jalapeño would all be great too. It’s your meatless taco night—do as you please. (On that note: These soy curls would be great tucked into burritos or scattered on nachos too.)These veggie tacos are hearty enough to skip a side dish altogether, especially if it’s a weeknight. But if you want to bulk up a spread for a party, check out this black bean salad with fresh lime juice, this farmers-market-inspired quinoa, or this make-ahead lentil salad (you can swap in a vegan cheese).

    "title": "Ricotta Pancakes With Blueberry Compote",
    "description": "“This [ricotta pancake recipe] isn’t for a boring breakfast,” explains cookbook author and former BA staffer Rick Martinez. “It’s a weekend beach brunch, best enjoyed with your new (hot) man (or woman) friend.” They’re absolutely loaded with blueberries: The finishing compote comprises jammy cooked berries and just-burst berries, added right at the end of cooking for texture, plus lots of lemon for brightness; the pancakes themselves are dotted with the juicy fruit. If you’d rather skip the blueberries, the pancake recipe will still work fine, but maybe add some lemon zest to the batter and slather with lemon curd for a lemon-ricotta pancake vibe (or swap in raspberries, huckleberries, or even dark chocolate chips and fudge sauce).Despite their abundance, these pancakes are still tender and fluffy thanks to whipped egg whites and the combination of buttermilk and baking soda. They’re also a bit hearty thanks to a portion of whole wheat flour. But it’s the compote that puts this recipe over the top. While you can make the sauce a couple of days ahead and reheat it, the prep time required is so minimal you might as well prepare it while making the pancakes. If you have any left over, spoon it over vanilla ice cream for your new hot friend.Looking for classic buttermilk pancakes? We’ve got you. Our best pancake recipe without any buttermilk at all?

    "title": "Actually-Crispy Zucchini Fries With Herby Yogurt Dip",
    "description": "During high school, my group of theater friends and I would, stereotypically, trek to our local diner after an evening performance as it was one of the few places that remained open late into the night. Our go-to order consisted of milkshakes, mozzarella sticks, and a heaping plate of zucchini fries to share. The fries would come out piping hot, shatteringly crisp on the outside, with a bowl of marinara sauce alongside for dipping. Were they mostly breading with barely any zucchini on the inside? Yes. Did we care? No. At the time, it hit the spot.It’s been a few years since I’ve been back to that diner, but I’ve carried the memory of those zucchini fries with me. Now when I make them for myself, I flip the ratio, using thick-cut zucchini so it’s mostly vegetable with just some breading. Panko, instead of regular breadcrumbs, delivers big, audible crunch while a little Parmesan, some dried herbs, and garlic powder mixed into the panko throw it back to the Italian vibes of the original marinara side.You don’t need the deep fryer setup of a diner to recreate perfectly crisp zucchini fries. A large skillet with a modest amount of oil is all it takes. If you’re really, truly adamant about not frying, you’ll be happy to learn that these work exceptionally well baked in a hot oven. The trick to actually crisp baked zucchini fries is to jump-start the cooking process by heating up your baking sheet. This, and a good film of oil, will ensure golden brown zucchini fries with perceptible crunch.As you’re placing the fries in the oil, carefully lay them away from you so you don’t accidentally splatter yourself. Tongs are a great tool for handling the fries and giving yourself some distance from the pan of hot oil.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 large zucchini (about 1¼ lb.), trimmed",
      "½ Zest of 1 lemon, plus more for serving",
      "¼ cup labneh or plain whole-milk Greek yogurt",

      "2¼ cups panko",
      "2¼ oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about ¾ cup)"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Cut 2 large zucchini (about 1¼ lb.), trimmed, in half crosswise. Cut each section in half lengthwise to get four quarters. Halve each quarter lengthwise to create 16 sticks total.",
      "Stir zest of 1 lemon, ½ cup labneh or plain whole-milk Greek yogurt, ¼ cup finely chopped tender herbs (such as dill, parsley, and/or basil), 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp.

    "title": "Just-Keeps-Getting-Better Lentil Salad",
    "description": "This lentil salad recipe answers the question, “What can I meal prep on Sunday that will taste great at my desk for lunch on Wednesday?” It’s got lots of lentils to keep you full, kale (for health!), salty olives, crunchy nuts, and just the right amount of feta cheese. It’s all tossed with a lemon dressing made with garlicky spiced oil. The salad is also fairly flexible. If you have some chickpeas, cherry tomatoes, or a diced red onion or red bell pepper on hand, you could add them, but it’s really not necessary. It’s also a great time to use up a pile of herbs: Any mix of chopped fresh mint, parsley, cilantro, or dill would be delicious here.Be sure to use beluga or French lentils (sometimes called lentils du puy, though they are technically not the same), which hold their shape when cooked. (Brown or red lentils will get too soft—you’ll end up with lentil soup rather than a great salad.) And cook them yourself—canned lentils aren’t nearly as good, and you can use the (very short) cooking time to get the rest of the salad ingredients together.For a Mediterranean-ish dinner party, serve this as a side dish with grilled fish or roasted chicken stuffed with fresh herbs and dressed with fresh lemon juice, plus tahini-rich hummus (drizzle a bit of the leftover vinaigrette over it). Store leftovers in an airtight container for the next day and the days after that.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 large bunch Tuscan kale (about 10 oz.)",
      "½ Kosher salt",
      "3 cup raw almonds",

      "1 garlic cloves",
      "½ lemon",
      "1½ cup extra-virgin olive oil",
      "1 cups black beluga or French green lentils",
      "½ Tbsp. cumin seeds",
      "5 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes",
      "1 oz. feta"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Strip leaves off stems from 1 large bunch Tuscan kale; discard stems or save for later! Stack leaves, then roll into fat cigars. Slice crosswise into ¼\" strips to long, thin ribbons. Unfurl ribbons and run your knife through them just once or twice more to shorten any very long strips. Transfer to a large bowl, season with salt, and massage until kale is silkier, softer, and darker in color, 1–2 minutes.",
      "Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil over high heat. While you’re waiting, prep the spiced oil. Coarsely chop ½ cup raw almonds; set aside. Trim 3 scallions and separate white and green parts (save the green parts for later in the recipe); thinly slice white parts and transfer to a small skillet. Smash and peel 4 garlic cloves. Add those to same skillet too. Using a vegetable peeler or paring knife, remove three 3\" strips of lemon peel (avoiding white pith); reserve rest of the lemon for your salad dressing. Add peels to skillet. Pour ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil into skillet and stir so that all of the elements are coated in oil.",
      "Add 1½ cups black beluga or French green lentils to now boiling water, reduce heat to medium, and simmer, uncovered, until lentils are tender but still al dente, 20–25 minutes (they’ll turn mushy if overcooked). We love to cook lentils like pasta—that is, in an abundant amount of salted water—so that we can monitor their doneness as they cook and make sure they don’t get too soft.",
      "While lentils cook, heat skillet with scallion mixture over medium. Cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic starts to brown and lemon peel starts to curl, about 3 minutes. Add almonds and cook, stirring frequently, until almonds are browned, about 3 more minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1 Tbsp. cumin seeds and ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes—the residual heat from the oil will bloom those spices and bring out their flavors.",
      "Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl, shaking to help oil drain; reserve oil (that’s the base of your salad dressing). Spread almond mixture (don’t forget those cumin seeds!) on a paper towel–lined plate or baking sheet. Season with salt and let cool (the nuts will get crunchier as they sit).",
      "Crumble 5 oz. feta into bowl with kale. Smash 1 cup Castelvetrano olives with the back of your knife; remove pits. Tear olives into large pieces and add to bowl. Thinly slice reserved scallion greens and add most to bowl (save some for serving). Add juice of reserved lemon and ½ tsp. salt.",
      "Drain lentils well, shaking to get rid of excess moisture, and add to bowl with kale; season with salt. Add infused oil and half of nuts and toss to combine.",
      "Divide salad among bowls. Garnish with remaining nuts and scallion greens. (If you’re taking this to work, just throw all of the scallions and nuts in at once—or bring them to work in separate containers and be that person garnishing your desk salad. You’re worth it.)

    "title": "Creamy Lemon Zucchini Pasta",
    "description": "Think of this zucchini pasta recipe as your gateway to the Italian summer in your mind’s eye. The fruit (yes, zucchini is a fruit) transforms into a pile of soft shreds with the help of a box grater. Cook it down with olive oil, onion, and garlic and it becomes a creamy, caramelized paste that’s great to spread on toast (like Jennie Cook’s Zucchini Butter, which inspired this recipe) or stir into scrambled eggs. But add a little pasta water, lemon juice, parm, and a glug or two of heavy cream and suddenly that paste transforms into a lush pasta sauce, perfect for slicking any long noodle you like.You’ll be amazed by how many zucchini cook down into this one pasta dish—a very good thing when you’re staring down a pile of it in August. To ensure the zucchini develops color instead of turning mushy, it’s imperative you squeeze the excess liquid out of it first: Just wrap the shredded zukes in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze with all your might. You can discard the liquid—or add it to your pasta pot.Fresh basil leaves and mint added at the end hammer home the summer vibe of this weeknight dinner. If you’re desperate for some crunch, a garnish of toasted panko breadcrumbs probably wouldn’t hurt. Or, if you’re craving color, a handful of halved cherry tomatoes would complement the dish beautifully.Looking for more ways to use up zucchini?

    "title": "Sheet-Pan Peppers and Chickpeas With Ricotta",
    "description": "This quick weeknight dinner comes together on not one but two baking sheets. On one, bell pepper strips get glazed in a sweet and punchy agrodolce, thanks to a mixture of honey and sherry vinegar (agrodolce means “sour-sweet” in Italian). On the other, spiced chickpeas and oily croutons are roasted until crisp. Because everything is better over a swoosh of creamy cheese, you’ll pile the contents of both baking sheets high on a bed of seasoned ricotta and finish with a garlic-parsley dressing. Here, the flavors of a deep, smoky romesco sauce cross with the textures of a loaded toast for a super satisfying platter you’ll likely scrape clean.The trick to the crispiest chickpeas is patting them as dry as possible before oiling them up for the oven. Moisture prohibits browning and causes your chickpeas to steam instead of roast. This includes any liquid trapped between the bean and its thin outer skin; if you have the time (and patience!), removing any loose skins helps a bunch.

    "title": "Tomato Bruschetta",
    "description": "There’s some built-in decision-making in this mostly classic bruschetta recipe from London’s iconic River Cafe. Will you go for French bread or Italian bread? Will you grill it or toast it? Follow your heart’s desire (because any combination is equally delicious), and you’ll be rewarded with crispy, garlic-slicked slices of bread topped with diced tomatoes that have soaked in buckets of flavor from marinating in red wine vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil. The result tastes like a summer aperitivo hour in Italy. (Serve them with a round of Campari spritzes if you know what’s good for you.)The best time to make this Italian appetizer is when plump fresh tomatoes aren’t just in season, but are at their peak. There’s no fresh mozzarella, Parmesan, or ricotta to hide behind here, so pristine tomatoes, fresh from the farmers market are the move—if you only have access to grocery store produce, choose cherry tomatoes and simply slice them in half, or go for a version with bolder flavors like this gingery bruschetta with scallions and sesame oil. Double down on tomatoes and pair with a big caprese salad.This recipe was adapted for style from ‘The River Cafe Classic Italian Cookbook’ by Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers. Buy the full book on Amazon.",

    "description": "As far as culinary staples go, fruit salad is an elder—it has been around for generations and it isn’t going anywhere. A fruit salad will always be easy, but a good fruit salad involves more than just a chop and a toss. At their best, fruit salads deliver an unexpected combination of color and contrast, and more often than not, include the small but substantive additions from spices, herbs, and aromatics that frame the lushness of the produce. The following version is one that I enjoyed for several months after having my baby, a combination of berries, stone fruit, melons, underripe mangoes, kiwi, and pineapple. The fruit is seasoned with a heady combination of sweet honey and ferocious Angostura bitters, accentuated by Tajín, nutmeg, and salt. The result is a familiar salad with flavors that taste fresh and exciting, even though you likely have many of the ingredients on hand.Allow the fruit salad to mingle with its dressing for at least 10 minutes before eating. You can also chill the fruit salad overnight; in that case, be sure to cut the fruit into larger pieces to preserve some of the texture.",

If you, too, grew up with parents piling carelessly cut tomatoes on any old piece of toasted bread and dropping it on the table with a flourish, this bruschetta is for you. But instead of the oft-abused balsamic vinegar of our youth (please, a moment of silence here for balsamic glaze), it’s finished with the explosive flavors of fresh ginger, nutty sesame oil, scallion, and a dash of soy sauce. Olive-oil-fried bread and fresh basil keep the familiar comfort of the classic in the background.Not all of us may be blessed with access to truly ripe tomatoes, which is why this recipe uses cherry tomatoes, suspiciously good all year round.

    "title": "Basil Chicken Stir-Fry",
    "description": "Modeled after Thai pad kra pao, this simple, speedy chicken stir-fry is wonderful for summer—and beyond. Where the traditional version uses fresh chiles, this recipe replaces them with bottled sambal oelek to keep things pantry-friendly. Combined with oyster sauce, fish sauce, and a bit of sugar, it’s a savory-spicy explosion of flavor that belies how quickly the dish comes together. Vigorously stirring the ground meat with a bit of liquid yields a bouncy texture, while the baking soda contributes to a juicy end result. This two-pronged approach transforms a lean protein (that often tastes dry) into something springy and tender.Sweet basil is an excellent substitute for the holy basil of the original; use the latter if you can find it. Outside of summer, swap in an equal quantity of baby spinach. Ground turkey or ground pork work well in place of the ground chicken.",

    "description": "The mantra for this eggplant Parmesan recipe should be: “Good things take time.” Trust us. Your efforts will be rewarded the moment you pull this dish of breaded eggplant slathered in tangy tomato sauce with a crispy, cheesy top from the oven. Need some reassurance? One commenter proclaims: “This was by far the best eggplant dish I ever made.”You can break the work into chunks over a couple of days. The homemade marinara sauce makes all the difference, so don’t swap it out for store-bought. This one is rich with tomato, wine, tons of garlic, and anchovies (the secret to everything) and can be made up to two days ahead; the flavors might even be better after a day of mingling. As for the fried eggplant and herby breadcrumb coating? Hold off making those until the day you plan to layer it all together.If you wish to serve this eggplant parm in neat blocks with defined stratum, let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes after baking. Garnish with more fresh basil just before serving and pair it with a simple side dish like a classic Caesar salad with lots of shaved Parmigiano Reggiano.",

    "description": "Chicken scarpariello is a classic Italian American dish of juicy braised chicken thighs, sweet Italian sausage, and a vinegary, sweet-sour pan sauce. The jury is out on why the recipe’s name translates to shoemaker’s chicken (and according to cookbook author Katie Parla, a Neapolitan dish by the same name refers to chicken cooked in a tomato sauce). But no matter, this version remains a weeknight showstopper.“My goal when developing this dish,” says Rick Martinez, “was that you should be able to make it on a Tuesday night after a long day at work—and not hate the guy that wrote the recipe after.” (Watch him make it here.)Some recipes include potatoes in the braise, but we prefer them roasted so they get nice and crispy (and served on the side so they stay that way). Skin-on chicken thighs are essential—they deliver flavor and won’t dry out; don’t try swapping them for boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Cooking them in the same pan as the onions and peppers ensures the browned bits at the bottom of the pan don’t go to waste.For the sauce, we like the flavor of Peppadews, but other pickled options like hot cherry peppers or pepperoncini work if you’d like a little extra heat.

    "title": "Creamy Gochujang Gnocchi",
    "description": "For my birthday last year, deputy food editor Hana Asbrink made a large pot of rosé tteokbokki, a cream-drunk version of the popular Korean rice cakes. Hana’s skillet was crowded with cylindrical rice cakes, pinkie-size hot dogs, and hard-boiled eggs. I squealed. I packed some deli containers to bring home, promising Hana I’d share it with my partner. In reality I only (very reluctantly) sacrificed a few spoonfuls and half an egg to him. No one could come between me and my birthday-bokki. I was utterly bedeviled.Rosé tteokbokki’s pandemic-era virality has been fanned by the flames of a social media landscape obsessed with rosé versions of various foods. Rosé sauce is thought to be a spicy, gochujang-rich take on tomato-cream sauce, itself an inspired (some would say corrupted) variation on Italian marinara. To me it is a charming emblem of how food travels across the world and morphs into new traditions. When I began to make it for myself (because, sadly, I couldn’t convince Hana to move in), I started to think about what I could use in place of tteok, an ingredient my colleagues and I love very much, but can’t always find in every grocery store.Turns out, a vacuum-sealed pouch of shelf-stable potato gnocchi is an admirable stand-in for Korean rice cakes. Compared to freshly made gnocchi, they’re doughy and dense, but in this case, that’s a good thing. As the gnocchi cook, their starch gently thickens the auburn sauce, all the while holding on to their shape and softening into a comforting chew. I like to think of it as a slightly wonky but full circle moment, a return to the vaguely Italian roots of rosé tteokbokki.Try not to skip the hot dogs. It is that vivacious jus de hot dog, achieved as the liquid boils cheerfully, that lays a foundation of gutsy flavor. A 10-oz. bag of frozen broccoli florets is a quick and convenient alternative to fresh broccoli with only a little textural sacrifice.",

    "title": "Sesame Tofu With Broccoli",
    "description": "A riff on the Chinese American classic sesame chicken, this sesame tofu recipe has tricks. When I was growing up, a block of tofu was a regular player in our weeknight dinner rotation: diced for soups and stir-fries, stuffed into fish cakes, or sliced and fried. Today, it’s my vegetarian household’s primary source of protein, used in dishes from all cuisines.Here, I wanted to ensure the pan-fried tofu had a crunchy coating to give the dish a lot of interesting texture. After trying several cornstarch alternatives, I determined nothing else would do: The cornstarch-coated cubes of crispy sesame tofu retained some crispiness even after soaking up the sweet, nutty sauce.And about that sauce: Those familiar with the meaty take-out staple might know the “sesame” component is often limited to a ceremonial scattering of sesame seeds on top. This plant-based version ups the ante by incorporating an untraditional but logical addition: tahini. Made of ground sesame seeds, it adds a delicious creaminess that complements the other sauce ingredients and gives an extra boost of savoriness. You may have already guessed that this is a vegan recipe, but note that it’s also gluten-free—as long as you use tamari (many brands of soy sauce contain wheat).",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 (14-oz.) block extra-firm tofu",

      "Drain one 14-oz. block extra-firm tofu and pat dry with a kitchen towel. Cut tofu in half horizontally through the equator (like a hamburger bun), then cut into 1\" cubes and pat dry again. Arrange tofu cubes in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet or large plate and set aside.",
      "Cut 1 large head of broccoli (about 1 lb.) into small 1\" florets. If your broccoli has a long stem, peel tough outer skin to remove the lighter fibrous layer, then slice stem ¼\" thick. Finely chop 1 scallion and set aside for serving.",
      "To make the sauce, scrape skin from one 1\" piece ginger with a spoon, then grate on a Microplane into a small bowl. Smash and peel 1 garlic clove and grate into bowl with ginger.

You will also need simple syrup, which is easy to make at home.The Siesta is traditionally served in a coupe glass, but you needn’t be bound by convention. Strain your drink into any cocktail glass you like. Top it off with a lime wheel garnish for a juicier beverage with an extra zhuzh of tang; or if you prefer a hint more bitterness and aroma, go for a strip of grapefruit peel instead.",

    "title": "Negroni Sbagliato",
    "description": "In Italian, sbagliato means “mistake,” so a Negroni sbagliato (or, simply, a sbagliato, as the drink is classically known) is a riff on the Negroni cocktail that came about “by accident.” A classic Negroni traditionally comprises equal parts gin, sweet vermouth, and bittersweet Campari; supposedly, a bartender invented this effervescent version in Milan in 1972 at Bar Basso when he mistakenly grabbed a bottle of sparkling wine instead of gin. If you’ve dined out or visited a cocktail bar in the US since October 2022, you’ve likely seen—or sipped—your share of the aperitif spritz.We can thank a viral TikTok from HBO for that. “In that video, Emma D’Arcy, star of House of the Dragon, told their costar Olivia Cooke that their drink of choice was a ‘Negroni…sbagliato…with prosecco in it.’ The pauses were pregnant; the eye contact was intense; and the internet lost its damn mind,” writes BA restaurant editor Elazar Sontag.A bottle of prosecco is the expected choice for this Italian cocktail, but cava or any inexpensive dry sparkling wine will do (save the Champagne for a more delicate French 75). Of course, you could also continue the tradition and trade it out for something else altogether: The team at Torrisi in New York uses fruity Lambrusco for the bubbles, garnishing the drink with a juicy orange slice. A finishing splash of soda water keeps the cocktail refreshing and not too sweet.",

    "title": "Pasta Alla Vodka",
    "description": "There are recipes that are arguably better left to restaurant chefs, but pasta alla vodka isn’t one of them. The dish is easy, requires little prep time, and is deeply satisfying. Before you convince yourself there’s no way that a little onion, tomato paste, and cream can come together in mere minutes to make one of the best homemade pasta sauces you've ever had, watch Molly Baz make it and then it yourself.Instead of canned tomatoes or tomato sauce, our version of this iconic Italian pasta dish relies on an entire tube of double-concentrate tomato paste, which according to Molly, contains 27 tomatoes per tube. Texture is key here; you want a glossy sauce. When you smash the garlic to remove the peels, be sure to give the cloves a good hard whack with the back of the knife so they melt into the sauté. A dash of chile flakes adds warmth without making things too spicy, but feel free to add more if you like it hot. Combining the cream with boiling water—and switching the stove to low heat before mixing it in—ensures the pasta sauce doesn’t break. Meanwhile, grating Parmesan on the smallest side of a box grater helps the cheese become one with the tomato-based sauce.And yes, you can use penne or your favorite pasta shape for this recipe, but we find rigatoni a touch more interesting. Garnish with fresh basil and serve with garlic bread and maybe a side veggie or salad.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 Kosher salt",
      "4 medium onion",
      "4 garlic cloves",
      "2 oz. Parmesan cheese",

      "Using a heatproof glass measuring cup, scoop about ¼ cup boiling water from pot, then add ¾ cup heavy cream to measuring cup (this brings up the temperature of the cream so it won’t break when you add it to the pot).",
      "Slowly add warmed cream to Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until a smooth sauce forms. Remove from heat.",
      "Add 1 lb. rigatoni to pot of boiling salted water; cook pasta according to package instructions until al dente. About 1 minute before the timer goes off, use heatproof measuring cup to scoop up about 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Heat Dutch oven over low.",
      "Using a spider, transfer rigatoni to Dutch oven along with any water that’s piggybacking on the pasta.",
      "Add ½ cup pasta cooking liquid to Dutch oven and stir to incorporate, then gradually add half of Parmesan, stirring constantly to melt cheese. You should have a smooth, glossy sauce that coats each piece of pasta. Season with salt and add a splash more pasta water to thin sauce, if needed.",

    "title": "Triple Strawberry Cheesecake",
    "description": "With a triple hit of fruit flavor, this strawberry cheesecake recipe is the only one you need. First, you’ll purée frozen berries into a classic cheesecake filling. Then, when the cheesecake is cooled, you’ll top it with fresh strawberries and brush saucy warmed strawberry jelly all over them for a shiny, showstopping glaze. Almost all the work is done in a food processor, in an order that won’t necessitate rinsing and drying the machine between tasks. Plus, blitzing the cream cheese with the other ingredients ensures a smooth filling, and means you don’t have to get out your stand mixer (or a dozen mixing bowls). It also cuts down on prep time.While many cheesecake recipes call for a hot water bath, you don’t need one here: The crown of berries (not to mention the vibrant, jammy strawberry sauce) will cover any fissures or imperfections. We love how the buttery shortbread plays with the flavors of the berries (think strawberry shortcake), but feel free to swap them out for Oreos (for a chocolate-strawberry cheesecake vibe) or a classic graham cracker crust.",

    "title": "Chorreadas",
    "description": "The Mazatlán-style chorreada is a regional delicacy enjoyed at taquerias throughout the lively beach town in the state of Sinaloa. Here a medley of chopped cilantro and onion dress citrusy steak on a refried-bean-slathered gordita. The gordita is a Mexican corn cake, made from masa harina that is sometimes stuffed, but serves as the chorreada’s golden base.Along the countryside of Costa Rica, you’ll find chorreadas that resemble arepas, or corn pancakes, usually eaten for breakfast with coffee. This recipe’s style of chorreada is regionally specific to Mazatlán and is characterized by the gordita as the base coupled with grilled steak on top. To achieve the perfect gorditas, it’s important to make sure they are no more than ¼\" thick. A tortilla press works well for this, but you can gently press the dough to the desired thickness on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Use your hands to round out the edges until there are no cracks in the dough and you have a smooth round.There’s no shortage of salsas throughout Mexico, and this taqueria-style version is commonly served on chorreadas. Charring the tomato, tomatillo, and onion imparts incomparable flavor. But this recipe is adaptable to swaps—your favorite store-bought salsa works too. And can also swap in a doctored-up can of refried beans (like La Preferieda); pinto beans are best for refried beans, thanks to their buttery texture and readiness to absorb spices. Although carne asada is what’s most commonly found in the Sinoalese chorreada, you can use this dish to show off grilled chicken, pulled pork, or charred shrimp. Or skip the meat altogether and just go with cheese.",

    "title": "Gluten-Free Banana Bread",
    "description": "When real estate agents talk about luring potential buyers at an open house with the smell of baked goods, they’re probably referring to banana bread specifically. Banana bread in the oven smells like comfort, like the very notion of home itself (as seen on TV, with a sleepy dog and flowers in the front yard). Every baker deserves a solid back-pocket recipe.Turns out, making the best gluten-free banana bread is just as easy as the regular version of this beloved quick bread. Where some recipes may use almond flour, oat flour, or coconut flour, this one turns to commercially available gluten-free baking flour blends that contain xanthan gum, as a reliable and convenient substitute for wheat flour. Our favorite gluten-free flour blends for this banana bread recipe are Cup4Cup and Bob’s Red Mill. For the most banana-y banana bread, use overripe bananas. Fruit that is speckled black is ideal since most of the starches have converted into sugar, resulting in a sweet and tender loaf with a strong fruit flavor. We like to weigh or measure out our mashed bananas to ensure a moist loaf that isn’t gummy, a common problem with many gluten-free banana bread recipes. A combination of baking soda and baking powder keeps this banana bread light and lofty.Looking to make this dairy-free? Use an equal amount by weight of melted coconut oil (either refined or virgin) in place of the butter. If you want to venture beyond chopped walnuts or pecans as mix-ins for your quick bread, a handful of chocolate chips would be a good idea. Add up to half a cup of chocolate chips, stirring them into the batter along with the nuts. Mini chocolate chips are especially great here as they distribute more evenly in the thick batter. Gluten-free baking comes with its own challenges. If you attempt to substitute coconut sugar or applesauce or flax eggs in place of light brown sugar and eggs, expect your banana bread recipe to perform differently.To make banana muffins, portion and bake the batter in lined muffin cups (the baking time will be shorter; start checking for doneness after 25 minutes).Baker’s Note: You can make your own gluten-free blend for this recipe: Stir together 1 cup (160 g) oat flour, 1 cup (120 g) white rice flour, ¼ cup (30 g) tapioca starch, and ½ tsp. xanthan gum to replace the commercial gluten-free flour blend below.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 Nonstick vegetable oil spray",
      "2 cup (110 g) pecans or walnuts",
      "2 cups (280 g) gluten-free flour blend with xanthan gum",
      "2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "1 tsp. ground cinnamon",
      "1 tsp. baking powder",
      "3 tsp. baking soda",
      "1 large very ripe bananas, mashed (1½ cups; 340 g)",
      "3 cup (200 g) light brown sugar",
      "½ large eggs",
      "2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled"

      "Vigorously whisk 3 large very ripe bananas, mashed (1½ cups; 340 g) and 1 cup (200 g) light brown sugar in a large bowl until no large lumps remain. Add 3 large eggs, ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled, and 2 tsp. vanilla extract and whisk to combine.",
      "Add dry ingredients to banana mixture and whisk until batter is smooth and thickened slightly, about 1 minute. Fold in nuts, then scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth surface. Lightly sprinkle with raw sugar (1–2 Tbsp.). Generously coat the blade of a small paring knife with nonstick spray; run knife lengthwise through center of batter to create a shallow cut (this is so bread will split cleanly along line as it bakes rather than cracking randomly).",
      "Bake bread until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 190° (a tester inserted into the center should come out with only a few moist crumbs attached), 60–80 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let bread cool in pan 15 minutes. Turn bread out onto rack and let cool completely (if you feel comfortable, carefully remove parchment paper so bread doesn’t turn gummy on the bottom).",
      "Do Ahead: Bread can be baked 2 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature."

    "title": "Basic Bulgogi",
    "description": "A staple of Korean barbecue, bulgogi translates to “fire meat” (a direct link to the tradition of making it by grilling marinated beef over charcoal). This bulgogi recipe requires minimal prep time, is endlessly adaptable, and was designed as a stovetop stir-fry—which means you can make it any time of year. In short, it’s an excellent weeknight main dish to keep in your back pocket.The sweet-salty bulgogi marinade pairs well with sliced beef, chicken, or pork—for a vegetarian version, try this recipe with eggplant. If you’re going for classic Korean beef bulgogi, pay special attention to the cut of meat. We like trimmed hanger steak or boneless short rib, but another tender, well-marbled cut like top sirloin, rib eye, flank steak, or skirt steak also works. Cutting the meat into thin slices so the marinade ingredients work quickly is key. If you live near a Korean grocery store, you can pick up presliced beef (look for Korean BBQ beef); if you’re cutting the meat yourself, freeze it for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour for easier slicing.Traditional bulgogi marinade calls for puréed or grated fruit such as kiwi, apple, or pear. Any type of pear will work with this recipe, but if you can access Korean pears (or another Asian pear variety), use those. The short marinating time gives you the chance to set your table with Korean side dishes (known as banchan), including kimchi and spinach namul, as well as everything you need to build little lettuce wraps: steamed white rice, green onions, toasted sesame seeds, ssamjang or gochujang, and crisp fresh lettuce leaves.",
    "ingredients": [
      "¼ pear, grated",
      "1 garlic clove, grated",
      "2 Tbsp. soy sauce",
      "1 Tbsp. gochugaru (coarse Korean hot pepper flakes), or 1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes (optional)",
      "1 Tbsp. grated peeled ginger",
      "1 Tbsp. light brown sugar",
      "1 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil",
      "1 lb. boneless pork loin, trimmed hanger steak, boneless short rib, or skinless, boneless chicken breasts or thighs",
      "2 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided"

    "steps": [
      "Combine ¼ pear, grated, 1 garlic clove, grated, 2 Tbsp. soy sauce, 1 Tbsp. gochugaru or 1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes (if using), 1 Tbsp. grated peeled ginger, 1 Tbsp. light brown sugar, and 1 Tbsp. toasted sesame oil in a large resealable plastic bag or medium bowl. Using a sharp knife, slice 1 lb. boneless pork loin, trimmed hanger steak, boneless short rib, or skinless, boneless chicken breasts or thighs into very thin strips. Add to marinade, seal bag, and squish everything around until meat is coated. Let sit at room temperature 30 minutes, or chill up to 8 hours.",
      "Warm 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large cast-iron skillet or other heavy pan over medium-high heat until oil is shimmering.

    "title": "Old-Fashioned Blueberry Coffee Cake",
    "description": "This blueberry coffee cake recipe is ideal for summer when you have a flat of fresh blueberries idling on your counter. But if you’re reading this in the dead of winter, don’t worry: It works with frozen blueberries too. And yes, you can also swap out the fruit for an equal amount of raspberries, blackberries, currants, or whatever else looks good at the farmers market.The recipe came to us via one of our Best New Restaurants for 2012, Cakes & Ale in Decatur, Georgia (now closed). Like many coffee cakes, it’s all about a mix of textures: the crumb should be moist and not overly dense, while the streusel topping should have a pleasing crunch that gives way to a burst of juicy berries. To achieve this, be sure to add the eggs to the mixing bowl one at a time and beat them thoroughly, which introduces air to the batter and ensures each ingredient is properly incorporated (a stand mixer is helpful here, but a hand mixer also works).When you’re layering, start with half the cake batter, then a ribbon of cinnamon sugar, followed by more batter, blueberries tossed in breadcrumbs (which soak up excess moisture and keep the berries from sinking to the bottom of the cake pan), and finally the buttery crumble topping. If you’d like, a dusting of powdered sugar wouldn’t be out of place, but we prefer this coffee cake without. Enjoy a slice with a cup of coffee and scrambled eggs over a leisurely weekend brunch, then wrap any leftovers tightly in plastic to snack on throughout the week.",

    "title": "Grilled Asparagus With Tahini Super Sauce",
    "description": "Don’t let the grocery store fool you—asparagus has a season (and it’s not the middle of August). Spring is prime time for these green stalks, when they’re at their bright, perky, taut-skinned best. If you’re grilling, roasting, or steaming asparagus, or otherwise planning to serve them whole, look for thick spears. The ratio of fiber to sweet tender flesh is better distributed than their pencil-thin (though admittedly elegant) siblings, and for the purposes of grilling, they’re easier to manipulate with less risk of falling through the grates. Save skinny asparagus for stir-fries, sautés, or other situations in which they’ll be sliced up.The season is short-lived, so the rules are straightforward: Cook asparagus simply and often, and serve it with something salty and fatty to offset its sweet, nutty grassiness. This tahini mayo is an instant favorite that checks all the boxes. It’s veritable super sauce as silky as hollandaise, with the anchovy-garlic sharpness of bagna cauda, both classic pairings for asparagus. The rest of the year serve the sauce with radishes or cucumbers to dip into, pooled under tomatoes, alongside breaded chicken, or tossed with kale as a sort of tahini Caesar.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 bunch thick asparagus (about 1 lb.), woody ends trimmed",

    "title": "Green Bean and Farro Picnic Salad",
    "description": "What constitutes a picnic salad, exactly? It’s a simple dish built to be packed up into a reusable container, toted to the park, and shared. A picnic salad is no worse for being eaten in direct sunlight—though it also excels straight from the fridge, making it an ideal make-ahead work lunch option. It’s zippy and light, but hearty enough to be a full meal if all that your friends bring is a pack of Solo cups and a bottle of rosé. It’s got pickled peppers for punch, white beans for protein, and cheese (two kinds!) for fun. The green beans get lightly smashed in a zip-top bag, taking on the flavors of the dressing but staying bright green and crisp, even after a few hours swimming in vinaigrette. The farro cooks in the same pot the green beans did, while they’re getting their marinade on (that’s called time management). You could even blanch the beans one day, stick them in the fridge overnight to marinate, and cook off the grains just before you want to serve. Picnic salad is the star of the potluck, the beach trip, the backyard hang. People will request the recipe. They can find it below.Seek out farro with “semi-pearled” on the label—this means that some of the outer hull of the grain has been removed, helping it cook in less time than whole grain farro while also retaining some fiber and hearty texture. “Pearled” farro cooks the speediest of all, but it eats more like rice without farro’s characteristic chew.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Lemonade",
    "description": "Don’t simply relegate this homemade lemonade recipe to the kids’ table—it’s tart, sweet, and intensely refreshing on a hot day. For the biggest bang for your lemon buck, you’ll start by infusing simple syrup with lemon zest. To get large pieces with as little pith (the bitter white part) as possible, dry the lemons and your hands well so that your grip is firm, and use a sharp vegetable peeler. Fresh-squeezed lemon juice is a must, so grab a juicer. To keep the ratio of tangy-to-sweet in check, add ice cubes straight to the glasses, not the pitcher, so the drink isn’t diluted.While this fresh lemonade needs no embellishments, it’s also a versatile base for a host of summer drink recipes: While the syrup steeps, muddle fresh fruit in the pitcher to make raspberry lemonade or strawberry lemonade. Watermelon? Peach? Sure, those work too. (About 2 cups of fruit per batch of lemonade should suffice.) If you prefer a bit of sparkle, swap out half the final pour of cold water for club soda or seltzer. For a full-blown spritz, use only the sparkling water (and maybe a splash of gin). You could also steep spices like sumac and cardamom in the syrup for something more complex or add a sprig of mint to each glass for something more aromatic. And mixing the prepared lemonade by half with brewed black tea quickly turns it into an Arnold Palmer. Prefer limeade? Swap out just half the citrus, lest the drink become too bitter.",

    "description": "Named after M.I.A.’s hit song, the Paper Plane cocktail was created for the opening of the Violet Hour in Chicago by bartender Sam Ross circa 2007. (FYI, Ross also developed the Penicillin). Now considered a modern-classic cocktail, early iterations of the drink balanced the bittersweet Italian liqueur Campari with nutty Amaro Nonino, bourbon, and lemon juice, explains Robert Simonson in The Encyclopedia of Cocktails, but Ross swapped out higher-proof Campari for its more delicate sibling Aperol when he put it on the menu at New York City bars Milk & Honey and Little Branch. Since then the drink’s popularity has spread across North America.If you’re new to mixing drinks, this aperitif is a good place to start since it’s an equal-parts cocktail recipe (and there’s no complicated garnish to master…unless you want to shape cute little orange or grapefruit zest airplanes). While a coupe is the traditional cocktail glass for serving it, a Nick and Nora glass (or even a rocks glass) would work if that’s what you have on hand.Amaro Nonino Quintessentia is still the amaro of choice for this drink recipe, but you can play around, swapping it out for Montenegro, Averna, Sfumato, or another bottle that looks enticing.",

    "description": "Forget hurricane glasses overflowing with a sticky-sweet concoction of sugary mixers and subpar booze. This frozen piña colada recipe is more dignified—but no less fun. When made with care, the preeminent summer drink balances sweetness and tang, has a creamy coconut edge, and packs a punch.You’ll need a good blender to achieve this rum cocktail’s slushie-like texture, but you’ll also need room in the freezer, so clear some space on an easy-to-access shelf before you get started. Using fresh pineapple slices adds extra brightness to the drink; if you can’t find a good one, an 8-oz. bag of frozen pineapple chunks will work. This version owes its richness to both cream of coconut and coconut milk, which get blitzed along with the other piña colada ingredients. Freeze the mixture (yes, in its blender jar!), then blitz again to reach that coveted texture. No matter where (or when) you’re serving this frozen cocktail, a little umbrella and a cocktail cherry (or a fresh pineapple wedge) is a nice finishing touch.If you’re short on time or freezer space but still hoping for a tropical drink at home, this Bird of Paradise with rum, pineapple juice, and Aperol comes together quickly, as does a mai tai or a mojito.",

Egg salad may have its detractors (smelly! mushy!), but fans know the unique comfort of that first bite—smooth dressing, slightly bouncy egg whites, velvety yolks, and maybe a little crunch from diced onion or celery. Stuck between soft white bread or piled onto toasted sourdough, it is a Platonic ideal of taste and texture.A great egg salad begins with great hard-boiled eggs. Soft or jammy egg yolks are good for many things, but they can leave an egg salad feeling runny and loose. For egg salad with textural integrity, firmly set (but not chalky) yolks are key. The best hard-boiled eggs are—surprise!—actually steamed. This technique doesn’t require a steamer or any special setup. Instead, you bring just a couple inches of water to a boil in a saucepan on the stovetop, lower the eggs in, cover the pan with a lid to trap the steam, and cook the eggs for about 10 minutes, much like traditional boiled eggs. Some people swear by the Instant Pot for easy-to-peel eggs but steamed eggs perform just as well and are substantially faster.Any classic egg salad recipe demands mayonnaise. (For our go-to brands, check out our mayonnaise taste test.) Sour cream and Greek yogurt simply don’t make the cut. Instead of peeling a whole white or red onion only to use a small portion of it in the egg salad, this recipe uses scallions, conveniently pre-portioned by nature and a breeze to slice. A dash of hot sauce, a healthy dose of Dijon mustard, and some salt and pepper are all that’s required to complete this simple egg salad. If you’re looking to throw in a little razzle-dazzle, choose one or two of the following ingredients and add in up to 1 Tbsp. each in your egg salad: fresh herbs like finely chopped chives, dill, or parsley; capers; or minced dill pickles.",
    "ingredients": [
      "6 large eggs",
      "1 scallion, finely chopped",
      "¼ cup mayonnaise",
      "1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard",
      "2 tsp. hot sauce (such as Crystal)",
      "¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or Morton kosher salt, plus more"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Pour water into a medium saucepan to come 2\" up sides and bring to a rolling boil. Using a large spoon, carefully lower 6 large eggs into pan one at a time. Cover and cook, adjusting heat as needed to maintain a simmer, 11 minutes.",
      "Using the same spoon, carefully transfer eggs to a medium bowl of ice water and let cool 10 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, stir 1 scallion, finely chopped, ¼ cup mayonnaise, 1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard, 2 tsp. hot sauce, and ¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl to combine.",
      "Gently crack eggs all over and peel, starting from the fat end containing the air pocket. Blot eggs dry with a kitchen towel. Halve lengthwise then coarsely chop; transfer to bowl with scallion mixture. Stir vigorously to combine (yolks should more or less dissolve into sauce). Taste and season with more salt if needed and freshly ground pepper."

    "title": "Basil Pesto",
    "description": "More than just a booster for pasta, homemade pesto is a versatile addition to any condiment arsenal. The herbaceous green sauce is equally at home coating blistered green beans as it is swooshed under lamb meatballs, dolloped on top of scrambled eggs, swirled into soup, or slathered on zucchini fritters.You will need a food processor for this basil pesto recipe. If you don’t have one, we highly recommend this as an excuse to get one; it’s a good investment you’ll use forever and ever and ever. Here’s how it’ll help when making pesto: To make the sauce creamy, you’ll want to work the oil into the pesto slowly. Letting the machine run while drizzling the oil through the feed spout makes this possible for anyone who is less than a master of balance and agility. But, if you’re a sucker for the old way of doing things, go ahead and pull out your mortar and pestle.The other key to great pesto is blitzing the garlic and pine nuts, allowing those ingredients to break down fully, before incorporating the basil. Adding the delicate herb last prevents it from being overworked and helps maintain its verdant color and flavor. If you’d like a little heat, add a dash of black pepper or crushed red pepper flakes. Depending on how you want to use the pesto, you may also wish to thin it out with ice water or lemon juice.If you’ve got a big bushel of farmers market basil, feel free to scale up the recipe and freeze the pesto in batches using an ice cube tray. Or, use this recipe as a blueprint to use up other ingredients, like cilantro or arugula in place of the basil; cashews, pecans, pistachios, pepitas, or sunflower seeds for the pine nuts; or Pecorino Romano or another hard Italian cheese for the parm.",
    "ingredients": [
      "½ cup pine nuts",
      "3 oz. Parmesan cheese, grated (about ¾ cup)",
      "2 garlic cloves, finely grated",
      "6 cups fresh basil leaves, loosely packed (about 3 bunches)",
      "¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil",
      "1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "12 oz. dried long pasta (such as spaghetti, linguine, or bucatini)",
      "2 Kosher salt"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Place rack in center of oven; preheat oven to 350°. Toast ½ cup pine nuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once halfway through, until golden brown, 5–7 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of a food processor and let cool.",
      "Add 3 oz. Parmesan and 2 garlic cloves, finely grated, and pulse until finely ground, about 1 minute. Add 6 cups fresh basil leaves and place the top back on. With the processor running, add ¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil in a slow and steady stream until pesto is mostly smooth with just a few flecks of green, stopping halfway through to scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary, about 1 minute. Season with 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt.",
      "Do Ahead: Pesto can be made 1 day ahead and refrigerated or frozen for up to 3 months. Top with ½\" extra-virgin olive oil to help prevent browning caused by oxidation. Store covered in an airtight container and chill; or freeze pesto in small portions and thaw out only what you need.",
      "If making Pesto Pasta, cook 12 oz. dried long pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving ½ cup pasta cooking liquid.",
      "Place pesto and 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces, in a large bowl. Add cooked pasta and ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid. Using tongs, toss vigorously, adding more pasta water if needed, until pasta is glossy and well coated with pesto sauce. Season with salt.",
      "Divide pasta among bowls. Top with finely grated Parmesan.",

    "title": "Golden Chicken Soup",
    "description": "There is literally nothing better than a big bowl of golden chicken soup. It cures everything and is a universally comforting dish. I gave birth to my oldest in the spring, during Passover, so I lived off of chicken soup. It was something I looked forward to daily, giving me the nourishment and comfort I needed during that time.To create a soup that really brings the flavor, I use skin-on, bone-in dark meat because, let’s be honest, it doesn’t dry out as quickly as white meat does, and it brings more richness to the broth. I love to add in a nice amount of turmeric, which not only contributes a beautiful earthiness and golden color, but also may have anti-inflammatory benefits. The ingredient that really takes this soup to another level is dried fenugreek leaves—you can find them online or at a South Asian market, labeled “kasuri methi” or “kasoori methi” (look for brands like Everest or MDH to start). Not only does it add beautiful depth to the broth, but fenugreek is also supposed to encourage milk supply, so the addition of the leaves may help if nursing is part of your motherhood journey.This soup keeps well in the freezer; if you choose to freeze it, make sure to shred the chicken off of the bone first. It’s easy to reach for and warm up, if you are enjoying it postpartum, or if you simply want a nourishing soup on hand for when the fam gets sick. I love to serve this as is, or with noodles or leftover rice. You can also add some leafy greens and/or legumes to transform this gorgeous broth into more of a stew.",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 chicken legs (thigh and drumstick; 2–2½ lb. total)",

    "title": "Soy-and-Cola-Marinated Steak",
    "description": "Marinating steak in Coca-Cola is a pro grilling move practiced by experienced cooks, including Korean grill masters, who rely on the soda to give bulgogi and kalbi an extra pop, and my own Midwestern mom. Soda’s unique blend of high acidity and sugar both tenderizes the meat and speeds up caramelization on the grill for the perfect char. This recipe borrows the technique, marinating skirt steak in a salty-sweet mix of Coca-Cola, soy sauce, garlic, and white miso. Be sure to use regular (not diet) cola, and don’t worry if the miso doesn’t dissolve while mixing; it will blend in as the steak marinates.",

The cucumber salad can be made up to 4 hours ahead; cover and chill until it’s time to serve. The fiery sauce is equally good poured over roasted chicken thighs or smeared over steamed tofu.

Based on the Clams Kimsino on the menu at downtown Brooklyn’s beloved Gage & Tollner restaurant, the breadcrumb topping pays homage to the classic flavors of clams casino with the punchy addition of chopped kimchi. (The name is also a cheeky nod to Gage & Tollner’s chef Sohui Kim.) Shrimp get simmered in a buttery white wine sauce boosted by the hot and savory flavors of kimchi to make a crimson sauce that doesn’t hold back. Piled high, the simple yet rousing dish is the perfect centerpiece to serve alongside greens or crusty bread.Because both the kimchi itself and the juices it’s packed in are used in this recipe, it’s important to buy one suited to your taste. Hotter, punchier varieties will result in a sauce that packs a serious kick while milder brands will produce a tamer dish. While the recipe calls for ½ cup of kimchi juice, if you don’t have enough in your jar, simply use what you have (there’s no need to supplement with more liquid).

Instantly, I'm transported to a golden hour vista where I'm enjoying the pasta alfresco in a sundress, with a crisp white or the last of a spritz within arm's reach. Here I conjure the quintessential warm-weather pasta with its briny clams and garlicky broth and throw in juicy Sun Gold tomatoes to add the perfect pop of sweet acidity. Give yourself enough time so that the clams get a good soak to rid them of any sand; swish some salt in a bowl full of water until dissolved and let the clams hang out for about 15 minutes. If the bottom of the bowl is full of grit, repeat the process; otherwise, carefully lift the clams from the saltwater (being careful not to disturb the sediment at the bottom) and place them in a colander until ready to use.

    "description": "This ginger-scallion sauce uses jarred pickled ginger (gari) in place of fresh for a brighter spin on the good-on-everything staple. Usually served in a twisted heap alongside a platter of sushi, gari is meant to cleanse the palate between bites of fish and rice. It’s that same refreshing quality that works so well in this sauce, with the sweetness and acidity of the pickles mellowing the sharper bite of raw scallions. Salt the cucumbers ahead of time, but dress the salad just before eating for a well-seasoned salad that still has some crunch.",
    "ingredients": [
      "5 mini seedless, Persian, or other small cucumbers (about 12 oz.)",

I use two kinds—earthy guajillo and fiery dried pequin—in a tomato-based salsa with a biting, lingering heat. This salsa does double duty, working as both a marinade and a glaze. There’s no need to soak the guajillos before simmering, though be sure to remove the seeds beforehand.",

    "title": "Chocolate Fudge Cake",
    "description": "This ultrarich chocolate fudge cake recipe is just the right level of fudgy. The trick to its airy but toothsome texture? A portion of almond meal, which also highlights the nutty notes of the chocolate and brings in extra richness, keeping the crumb moist for days. (If you’re baking for someone with a nut allergy, try our Brooklyn Blackout Cake instead.) Perhaps this should go without saying, but when intense chocolate flavor is the point, using good-quality unsweetened cocoa powder and chocolate is crucial. For both the cake and buttercream, opt for a bar or wafers of bittersweet chocolate from companies like Scharffen Berger or Guittard over run-of-the-mill semisweet chocolate chips.Beating the butter, sugar, and eggs thoroughly ensures the crumb of this fudgy chocolate cake has some lightness. A stand mixer makes things easier, but an electric handheld one will also work—though you may need an extra set of hands to help alternate adding dry and wet ingredients when mixing the cake batter. BA reader Dhanya Samuel, who submitted this recipe to our 2016 Readers’ Choice Week contest, baked her cake in two different sized heart-shaped baking pans, but we opted for round cake pans to keep things simple.

    "title": "Chicken Yakisoba",
    "description": "This simple chicken yakisoba recipe combines the savory flavors of stir-fried noodles with bite-size pieces of soy-soaked chicken thighs for a satisfying dinner you can pull off any weeknight. A classic Japanese noodle dish, yakisoba (literally “fried noodles”) is made with wheat-based egg noodles that are stir-fried and slicked in a savory-sweet yakisoba sauce, often made from Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, oyster sauce, and more.Our version skips the Worcestershire in favor of heavier doses of soy and oyster sauces to really home in on their particular umami profiles, and rounds out the sauce ingredients with a bit of mirin (Japanese cooking wine). The resulting glaze coats the noodles and chicken, helping them caramelize as they sauté in the pan, and adding depth and complexity to each bite. We’ve opted to use bell peppers, cabbage, and mushrooms to enhance the dish, but you can swap in whatever vegetables you have on hand, such as bok choy, thin strips of zucchini, bean sprouts, scallions, or carrot matchsticks.If you can’t find yakisoba noodles at your local market, seek them out at an Asian grocery store, or swap in fresh ramen noodles (like the ones from Sun Foods), or homemade udon or miki noodles.",

    "title": "Nashville Hot Chicken",
    "description": "Nashville hot chicken is nothing new. The fiery take on classic Southern fried chicken has been a staple of the Black community in Middle Tennessee since at least 1945 when Prince’s Hot Chicken Shack first opened its doors. Still, many don’t realize that the primary source of heat comes not from a tingle-inducing marinade or an ultra-spicy breading. Instead, the final flourish for this iconic spicy fried chicken is a wash of chile-infused hot oil, introduced to the crispy pieces of chicken after they come out of the fryer. This version, from the relative newcomer but already ubiquitous Hattie B’s, calls for adding 6 Tbsp. of cayenne and other spices to the sauce. They consider it “medium”; if you’re worried about your ability to take the heat, reduce the cayenne to 2 Tbsp..Like many of the best fried chicken recipes—making Nashville hot chicken is a bit of a process. Don’t try to take shortcuts by swapping in boneless meat; bones ensure the chicken stays moist and flavorful. If you don’t care to break down the bird on your own, ask your butcher to cut a whole chicken into 10 parts (2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, and 2 wings, plus 2 breasts that have been halved into equal portions). You can get ahead on your prep time by seasoning the chicken (simply with salt and pepper) a day ahead. You can also apply the breading and slide the (uncovered!) baking sheet into your fridge for up to 2 hours before frying.This Nashville hot chicken recipe makes enough for a party or picnic. The classic sides of white bread and pickles (dill pickles are the go-to, but sweet bread and butter pickles also make a nice contrast) help to cool your palette. Finish off the spread with a big bowl of coleslaw or a mustardy potato salad, plus plenty of paper towels. If you make the chicken a day ahead, don’t bother reheating it. It’s just as delicious cold...or, um, hot and spicy...right out of the fridge.Looking for a hot chicken sandwich? Try this one, which stacks crispy boneless chicken thighs with a gochujang glaze.",

    "title": "Chocolate Chipless Cookies",
    "description": "“Chocolate chipless cookies? But like, what even is the point?” asked more than one befuddled colleague when I told them I was developing a chocolate chip cookie recipe minus the chocolate chips. “I don’t know, just the perfect distillation of buttery, butterscotch-y cookie essence?” I replied, wild-eyed, deep in the midst of my 11th batch. They’re not chocolate chip cookies and they’re not sugar cookies either—they’re an elusive middle ground, a gravity-defying bridge between two worlds, a crack in the space-time continuum.Without the chocolate for melty-gooey texture and bittersweet flavor (or any other add-ins), cookie dough has nowhere to hide. Every ingredient has to work hard, hitting its full potential, especially the big three: sugar, butter, and flour. This means dark brown sugar in lieu of light brown or white sugar for maximum molasses notes. Instead of simply being creamed or melted, butter is browned, bringing a host of nutty, toasty overtones. It’s with the flour that things take an unusual turn. How does one make plain all-purpose flour—bland and starchy but essential for structure—more flavorful? By toasting, it turns out. Think about the brown crust on bread, the deepness of a New Orleans gumbo, or the golden bottom of a cookie. All of these are extremely delicious because the flour has experienced a Maillard reaction. Toasting a portion of the flour in butter on the stovetop, before working it into the dough, is a cheaty way of boosting these flavor compounds, saturating the cookies with a toffee-like goodness. Don’t be afraid to take it far; you’re looking for the color of milky coffee—if the mixture begins to smoke, get it off the heat.Even with all the tricks up its sleeve, these chewy cookies come together in under an hour, no stand mixer needed. But be warned: They are inherently divisive. You’ll either face impassioned disbelief that the chocolate is absent or relieved delight. Presenting them to someone in the former camp? Call them “brown sugar cookies” and move on with your day. But for those of us in the latter camp, here is the ultimate version of a chocolate chipless cookie, with soft buttery centers good enough to make even the chippers of the world turn on their tribe.",

    "title": "Easy Steak With Pan Sauce",
    "description": "Pan sauce, without a doubt, holds the record for most wasted potential in the kitchen. Sure, the steak is important, but its drippings are too often relegated to the waste bin when they could easily have been transformed into a punchy buttery sauce. Well, no more! This easy steak pan sauce recipe ensures a restaurant-quality dinner, achievable at home on any given weeknight.The method works with all cuts of steak, from rib eye to hanger to fillet, but you don’t have to stop at beef. Your pan-seared pork chops and chicken thighs could use this glossy sauce too. If you’re new to making pan sauces, here are a few things to know: (1) Avoid nonstick pans here. A cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet helps achieve a good crust on the meat, and the browned bits (known as fond) on the bottom of the pan add a lot of flavor. (2) You do not need all of the drippings—you’re going to add butter, so mop any blackened oil with a paper towel. (3) Deglazing is essential. Here, we use water for ease, but red or white wine, which adds acidity, also works, as does beef broth or any stock you have on hand. (4) Adding butter at the end emulsifies the sauce, bringing everything together—don’t skimp.We prefer a medium-rare steak, and this recipe will guide you there. But investing in a meat thermometer is the surest way to reach your ideal doneness. Remember, the temperature will continue to rise to the next level of doneness, so for medium, pull it from the heat when the temperature reaches 130°; for medium-well, 140°; and for well-done, 150°.You don’t need much besides this steak and sauce for dinner: red wine, good bread, and a simple green salad—maybe with some finely chopped shallots and fresh herbs.",

Pozole blanco, or “white pozole,” omits chiles but still packs a punch with a garlic-and-onion-filled broth that comes together in minutes. Small, tender pieces of pork and chewy hominy simmer in the fragrant broth to add a welcome meaty, starchy richness before being topped by a balancing mix of crisp, fresh accompaniments: shredded cabbage, thinly sliced radishes and creamy wedges of avocado.",

But lots of great drinks are even more fun when they’re frozen, and this low-ABV, brunch-friendly little number is no exception.Rather than starting with liquid orange juice and diluting with ice, I keep things chilly (and extremely low-effort) by using frozen orange juice concentrate. A touch of salt helps bring out the flavor. If your blender is quite large, you may be able to double the recipe and use the whole tube of orange juice concentrate, just make sure there’s room for all that ice. If you’re not working with a high-powered machine, you can help it along by starting with crushed ice instead of big cubes.",

    "description": "Sulguk literally translates to \"alcohol soup\" and is one of many types of haejangguk, or Korean hangover stews. Usually a hearty soup brimming with vegetables and meat and served with rice, haejangguk is meant to chase away your hangover by loading your body with ingredients that soothe any upset stomach and help sweat out the alcohol from the night before. There’s a wide variety of regional haejangguk across Korea, ranging from a super-savory soybean-paste-based broth with dried Napa cabbage and ox blood in Seoul to a refreshing soybean sprout soup in Jeonju that’s seasoned with salted fermented shrimp and topped with chopped squid. This sulguk is a slightly larger casserole-style version meant to be eaten while drinking, but you can also throw it together the morning after for a proper haejang (we love a double-duty dish!). I like to use a Korean-style milky beef bone broth for the base, which you can find packaged at Asian grocery stores (or if you’re up for it, make your own). The savory, spicy broth simmers with Korean blood sausage, mounds of mushrooms, fish cakes, and a block of instant ramyun for good measure, but feel free to sub in vegetables and meats of your choice. For extra credit, simmer tableside on a portable gas stove while you drink Korean-style.",

    "title": "Double Dark Chocolate No-Churn Ice Cream",
    "description": "Vodka might seem like an unexpected ingredient to use in ice cream, but its presence proves invaluable in achieving a creamy texture without having to use an ice cream machine. Alcohol has a low freezing point (around -16°F), and just a splash will keep the batch silky smooth as it chills in a home freezer. It’s a fuss-free recipe that doubles down on the chocolate to create an intense flavor experience that rivals the fanciest of store-bought pints. The base is made by combining just six ingredients directly in a blender and blitzing them until luscious and mousse-like. Then a glossy homemade fudge sauce—made in just 10 minutes and without a candy thermometer—gets drizzled into the base after it’s dolloped into a loaf pan. Post-freeze, it strikes the ideal balance between rich, sweet, and bold, and it scoops just like the best, most custardy gelato.To achieve the most dramatic ripple, pipe or drizzle the hot fudge sauce in thick ribbons and resist the urge to swirl them into the ice cream base. You want wide, distinct bands of fudge throughout. But for the final topping, swirl away—a twirling cosmic pattern makes for a striking presentation.",

Morton kosher salt in a blender, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium and scraping down sides as needed, until aerated and very fluffy like mousse, about 1 minute. (Mixture will stick to sides of blender and no longer move when done.)",
      "Scrape about one third of ice cream base into chilled loaf pan and smooth into an even layer with a spoon.

It all comes together shockingly fast (no really, not much longer than it would take you to prepare instant ramen!). Give it up for your grocery short-cut favorites: boxed stock, frozen dumplings, and bagged spinach. Soy sauce, fish sauce, and toasted sesame oil provide umami and depth that belie the quick cooking time. The key to creating feathery, silky ribbons of egg (instead of tough and stringy ones) lies in the slurry: Whisk a teaspoon of cornstarch or potato starch in water until fully dissolved and blend it into your egg mixture before pouring into the soup.",

Bartender extraordinare Audrey Saunders first paved the way with her ever-popular Earl Grey-tini at Pegu Club in New York City. And unlike the aforementioned coffee cocktail, you don’t need to buy any special-flavored liqueurs or pull shots of espresso to make one. Plain vodka is ideal for extracting flavor without heat. Simply steep tea bags in room-temperature vodka to infuse the spirit with notes of citrusy, bittersweet bergamot and black tea in only five minutes. The resulting vodka pairs nicely with dry vermouth and fresh lemon for a floral, frothy cocktail ready for happy hour—or even tea time.Shaking your cocktail with an egg white creates a creamy, rich texture that mimics the foamy smoothness of a London Fog (an Earl Grey tea latte). It also tones down the sharpness of the drink, mellowing out the vodka’s burn to create a chiller sip. We promise it’s delicious. But for those opposed to the idea of drinking raw egg whites, this cocktail is still wonderful without it.",

    "title": "Americano",
    "description": "Not to be confused with the morning espresso drink, the Americano cocktail is meant to start your evening. The lightly alcoholic drink is a touch bitter; it whets your appetite and goes wonderfully with little predinner snacks. The formula is simple: a mix of bitter liqueur and fruity fortified wine lightened with sparkling water. Build it right in the glass you plan to drink from, starting with a splash of soda water first—that way, the heavier vermouth and bittersweet Campari don’t just sit on the bottom of the glass.Carpano Antica Formula is a luscious, vanilla-tinged sweet vermouth that’s easy to like in this low-ABV aperitivo; if you prefer your Americano a bit more bitter and herbal, try it with Punt e Mes. We’re living in a new age of quirky, delicious smaller-batch vermouths (both American and international); your best local wine or spirits shop may have some treasures. A few of my current favorites: Fred Jerbis Vermut, Foro Rosso sweet vermouth, and juicy Cucielo Rosso, which is new to the US. Whatever bottle you open, stash it in the fridge—like wine, it won’t last forever.A simple orange twist boosts the drink’s aroma, but for a bit more sweetness, you can garnish with an orange slice instead. For a touch of savory flavor, toss in an olive or three.If the equal-parts nature of the aperitif and vermouth feels familiar, you may notice that switching out the sparkling water here for gin will turn your drink into a negroni. Remove the third wheel altogether, and you’ve got the bold and brassy Milano-Torino.Got more Campari to use up?

Bold cold-brew coffee concentrate takes well to the earthy, softly smoky flavors of mezcal, cinnamon, and vanilla, and the frozen banana adds luxurious texture and a touch of sweetness to the drink. Serve at brunch with French Toast Casserole or a basket of muffins, or spin up a round as a vacation afternoon pick-me-up. Be sure to start with ripe bananas—whenever they start going spotty, just peel and stash in your freezer.",

    "title": "Dirty Martini Chicken Thighs",
    "description": "This cheeky chicken dish takes its cues from the king of cocktails: the dirty martini. A healthy pour of vodka stands in for the more typical beer or wine in this braise, lending its distinct piercing brightness and a touch of boozy heat. The spirit’s sharp top notes cut through the heaviness of the ultra-savory pan sauce, much like vinegar or lemon juice but with a bit more bite. As is the case in a classic vodka sauce for pasta, the alcohol helps the dish straddle the line between rich and vibrant. As it all simmers, you might as well mix up a drink for dinner too; you’ve got all the ingredients at the ready.For the best flavor, Castelvetrano olives are the move here. Their firm, meaty texture means they hold up well during cooking, and their mild, buttery flavor isn’t as salty as other types. Because you are using both the olives and the brine they are packed in, it’s a small luxury worth investing in. You can find them already pitted—jarred, canned, or at an olive bar, if your grocery store has one.",

    "title": "Pecan Sandie Wedges",
    "description": "For shortbread, buttery texture is everything, which is why most recipes limit the liquid they use and rely on eggs as the only binder. Bakers are hesitant to add water, which, when worked with flour, creates gluten. But dry shortbread dough is hard to work with and often results in overly brittle cookies that shatter instead of melt in your mouth. The solve? Using vodka to moisten the dough instead. Vodka interacts with flour differently than water, creating no significant gluten formation because it can’t hydrate the proteins properly. Just two tablespoons creates an easy-to-work-with dough. Baked into wedges, these sandies strike the perfect balance between tender and pleasantly crumbly, with deeply toasted pecans and rich brown butter for an extra nutty flavor. They’re a fresh take for those who grew up with the packaged variety “made by elves.”Instead of cutting shortbread into ornate shapes or forming into precise soldier-like planks, this recipe opts for pressing the dough into a pan, which cuts back on prep time and creates a laid-back look. Just make sure you cut your dough into wedges before it hits the oven; this initial scoring ensures the baked shortbread can be sliced into neat wedges without breaking apart.",

Immediately pour into a small metal bowl, scraping in any browned bits at bottom of pan, and freeze until butter is solidified but still slightly soft (it should be spreadable), 15–20 minutes.",

Add 1 large egg yolk, 2 Tbsp. vodka, and 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract and beat on medium speed, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until very light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Stop motor and add 1¾ cups plus 2 Tbsp. (234 g) all-purpose flour, 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and ½ tsp. baking powder to bowl.

    "title": "Campari Spritz",
    "description": "A Campari spritz recipe is a personal thing. Some like theirs sweeter, others just faintly flavored with the iconic Italian aperitivo. In general, a spritz made with Campari will have a drier profile than spritz made with Aperol and offer more bitter flavors. We love the proportions below—the 3-1-1 ratio is so easy that you’ll likely memorize it after the first try.Consider this recipe a starting template. If you crave a richer version, top your Campari spritz with more of the bright red bittersweet aperitif; or, if you prefer a lighter predinner drink (or find that your sparkling wine is a bit sweet), pour in a bit more soda water. For maximum carbonation, start with chilled bubbles and don’t stir too aggressively: A single tour around the glass will do. While you can tweak the ratios to your taste, the order of operations matters. Campari is heavier than wine and sparkling water: Add it first and it will simply sink to the bottom of the glass. But start with a pillow of sparkling wine—pick any dry prosecco, domestic sparkling, Crémant, or Cava that you’d be willing to drink on its own—and you’ll encourage the drink to mix all on its own. You could also experiment with other aperitivi and amari: Keep it rosy-red with herbal Bitteroma, gentle Cappelletti, or your favorite locally made aperitivo, or go bolder with an amaro like Cynar. You can even combine two different bottlings in one drink as long as the total measure of bitter liqueur remains the same.The Campari spritz is great with salty snacks, which is why some enjoy it with an olive garnish. But an orange slice or grapefruit wedge makes for a juicier drink that boasts a certain freshness. Want the citrusy aroma without the extra sweetness? Twist an orange peel over the glass and drop it in.Got extra Campari on hand? Try it in a Frozen Garibaldi, Frozen Negroni, Negroni Sbagliato, or an Americano.

    "title": "Haemul Pajeon (Seafood Pancakes)",
    "description": "You may have ordered haemul pajeon (seafood scallion pancakes) as an appetizer at a Korean restaurant before. The classic anju, or Korean drinking food, is often enjoyed with makgeolli (rice beer) and popular for two very good reasons: its golden, crispy edges and the kicky dipping sauce.Haemul pajeon are filled with scallions (pa), a variety of seafood (haemul), and dotted with vibrant red chiles (really just for show!). You'll often find oysters, clams, and shrimp in the mix to give brininess and a chewy bite. While you can certainly use fresh seafood, the trick that makes my Korean seafood pancake recipe a cinch to prepare is that I keep my favorite frozen seafood medley on hand at all times. Available in most supermarkets, these mixes usually include some combination of shrimp, squid, and bay scallops; they’re a fantastic addition to your freezer pantry, allowing you to turn out a last-minute chowder or paella on a whim. The frozen seafood will defrost in the amount of time it takes you to prep the rest of your ingredients; just be sure to pat it dry before chopping and adding to the pancake batter.In Korea shoppers often rely on the convenience of a pancake mix like this one for making jeon, but you probably already have the dry ingredients called for in my DIY version below. When served, diners usually tear hunks off the large pancakes with their chopsticks, but you can cut them into squares for ease. The big tip here is to use plenty of oil in the frying pan to ensure crispy, golden brown edges—do not be stingy! Complete the meal with a banchan (side dish) of kimchi.",

As much as I love traditional tiramisu made with punchy espresso, I wanted to create an alternative with more gentle notes. In this version, Earl Grey tea is infused in the Grand Marnier–spiked soaking liquid and speckled throughout the mascarpone cream, doubling down on the floral, citrusy flavor.A few tips for tea-ramisu success: First, keep your eye on the clock when steeping your tea bags. Anything longer than 10 minutes and your tea will take on an unpleasant bitterness. Second, I know 10 bags may seem like a lot, but believe me, you need them. The large quantity is necessary in achieving a quick concentration. Third, be careful when dunking the lady fingers—turn each one in the liquid for just a few seconds, otherwise they’ll disintegrate. Lastly, don’t rush the resting process—this beauty needs at least four hours to properly meld. The tea flavor becomes more pronounced with time, plus the cream texture becomes more custardy as it sets.",

    "title": "Crispy Fried Shrimp and Giardiniera",
    "description": "A vodka-and-cornstarch-based batter creates a coating that fries up gloriously golden brown, with a seriously crunchy exterior that gives way to tender bites of shrimp and tangy giardiniera. One cup of liquor might seem like a shocking amount, but it’s what makes the fry so intensely crisp. The alcohol in vodka won’t bind to flour to create gluten (the culprit responsible for chewy, cake-y fried batters and tough cookies) and evaporates a lot quicker than water. Once the shrimp and giardiniera hit the hot oil, the moisture in the coating starts to dissipate rapidly, transforming it into a puffy shell far lighter and airier than its water-and-beer-based counterparts.Use vinegar-based giardiniera in lieu of oil-packed (a.k.a. Chicago-style) for the zippiest flavor. The extra pop of acid will cut through the rich batter and provide a welcome freshness, much like vinegar showered over fish and chips. Look for a variety of giardiniera with large pieces, as they are the easiest to batter. But don’t fret if there are some tiny bits; any pieces too small to batter can get chopped up and added to the dipping sauce.",

    "title": "Fudgy Weed Brownies",
    "description": "The only thing better than telling a friend “I’ll bring dessert?” Telling them: “I’ll bring pot brownies.” This edible is a classic for good reason—the intensity of chocolate both camouflages and complements the earthiness of cannabis. In this weed brownie recipe, thanks to Dutch-process cocoa powder, deeply toasted nuts, and a sprinkle of flaky sea salt, you might not taste the marijuana at all. If you bring these to a gathering, announce and label them accordingly so everyone knows what they’re getting into.Infusing butter with weed, which is the first step of these cannabis brownies, is an art in and of itself. There are several ways to go about it. If you’re new to cooking with weed, I highly recommend reading Mennlay Golokeh Aggrey’s step-by-step guide to cannabutter to familiarize yourself with the nitty-gritty terms. But if you’re revving to get going, everything you need is on this page. Inspired by that explainer, as well as the work of Vanessa Lavorato and my own trials over the years, this cannabutter is built for ease. With a quick infusion—just an hour extracts the vast majority of the cannabinoids while keeping the flavor mellow—you can make the cannabutter and bake the brownies all in one day.There is a dizzying array of cannabis strains at dispensaries these days. You may be familiar with the terms sativa (often described as “daytime”) and indica (“nighttime”), but these catchalls can only predict so much. How your body processes weed depends on your body. (Did you just eat or work out? Are you seven feet tall?) If you’re near a dispensary, chat with the folks who work there. Tell them you’re planning to use the flower to infuse butter for brownies and what experience you’re hoping for (perhaps a chill Sunday watching Abbott Elementary).We developed this recipe with a hybrid strain with 19.96% THC—let’s say 20% to keep the math simple. Starting with ½ gram cannabis shakes out to 100 mg THC for the whole pan of brownies. If your strain is not 20%, here are the guidelines for portioning your batch: Multiply 500 mg cannabis by your THC percentage to get the total amount of THC per pan of brownies (so a 15% strain would create a batch containing 75 mg THC). Divide that by the number of pieces and you get the dose per piece. If you want to get technical, all homemade cannabis edibles suffer inevitable THC loss through the steps of decarboxylating, infusing, and baking, but we like to err on the side of overestimating the THC rather than the reverse. Being high is fun—being too high is not.On that note: Our editors have asked you to buy a kitchen scale many times and maybe you already did and that is great. But if you didn’t—really, seriously—now is the time. If baking is precise, baking with cannabis is more precise. You want to know exactly how much cannabis you are starting with. In this case, a gram is an enormous difference. Unfortunately, most kitchen scales (like the Escali one we use in our test kitchen) are not precise enough for small-batch cannabaking; ½ gram cannabis and 1 gram cannabis can register as the same thing, which they most certainly are not. For accurate dosing, you need a scale that is precise down to tenths of grams—I have this cheap model and it works great.Likewise, an oven thermometer and instant-read thermometer are invaluable here. The oven thermometer guarantees that when you decarboxylate (step 1), you don’t burn your weed, which would compromise the efficacy of the THC. Many ovens are hotter than their dials or screens imply, and in this recipe, being off by 50° could ruin the whole batch. Likewise, an instant-read thermometer ensures the cannabutter infusion (step 2) stays on track. I know what you’re thinking—that’s a lot of equipment to buy for a batch of brownies. But once you have these tools, you’re all set up to turn homemade edibles into your new hobby (you’ll make so many friends). And they come in handy in loads of other places, like baking cookies or searing steak.With respect to dosing, if you have one, use a ruler to cut the brownies. Were no weed involved, this would be embarrassingly fussy. But there is weed involved! Carefully cut pieces means reliable dosing. For cannabis with 20% THC, an 8x8\" pan cut into 12 pieces shakes out to about 8⅓ milligrams THC per piece. This is just right for many, but some prefer less, others want more. You do you. For a smaller dose, cut 16 pieces for about 6¼ mg THC per piece. For a larger dose, cut 9 pieces for about 11 mg THC per piece. If this is your first time trying an edible, go small—you can even cut 32 pieces for 3⅛ mg THC per piece. Resist the urge to eat more if you’re not feeling anything. The effects can kick in within 30 minutes but might take 2 hours or more.If you are allergic to nuts (or just don’t like them), you could swap in ⅔ cup semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips or chunks.Editor’s note: Many states in the US are 420 friendly, but cannabis is still federally illegal.

    "title": "Easy Noodle Kugel",
    "description": "Like many iconic Jewish dishes, noodle kugel recipes invite heated debates: Sweet noodle kugel or savory?! Naked or topped with cornflakes? Wide noodles or extra-wide noodles? Golden raisins, dried cranberries or apricots, or no fruit at all? What about cream cheese? Or cottage cheese? Everyone has an opinion. When Sarah Jampel developed this recipe, she writes: “I putzed! I fussed! I schmoozed! I schlepped! I kvetched! I ate a lot of kugel until, finally, we landed on one (so soft! so bouncy!) we felt would please the fanatics, persuade the haters, and entice the uninitiated.”Her version of every Jewish holiday’s favorite noodle pudding is a touch sweet and a little eggy, landing somewhere between airy and rich, with small curds from cottage cheese. Tugging on a few noodles so they breach the surface means you get golden brown bits that crunch. And don’t tell your guests, but we like the pieces from the corner of the casserole dish—where the noodles get crispy from the heat of the pan—best. Save those for yourself. Make it for Shabbat. Make it for brunch. Just make it—we promise you’ll love it.Looking for more kugel recipes? Try Michael Twitty’s apple and honey rice kugel.

    "title": "Sheet-Pan Halloumi With Avocado and Citrus",
    "description": "This feel-good dinner makes the most of your time. Because you’re busy. You don’t have all day. I hear you. That’s where multitasking comes in: While hunks of Halloumi cheese and pita shards toast in the oven, you’ll slice up juicy citrus (snag blood oranges if you can for their vibrant hue), kicky shallot, kickier jalapeño, and fresh dill (cilantro and parsley also work if that’s what you have). Then you’ll whip up a lime-and-honey dressing to wake everyone up. Inspired by fattoush, a Middle Eastern bread salad, the toasted pita happily soaks up the vinaigrette. Scoops of buttery avocado top it all off, yielding a one-dish supper or brunch I’d eat every week if I could. And maybe I will.There’s no substitute for the Halloumi. When cooked, this Cypriot cheese develops a crispy-salty crust, not unlike a skin-on chicken thigh, while resisting melting at all costs. It’s often singed on a grill or seared in a pan, but the method here is more hands-off. Thrown on a hot baking sheet (just toss it in the oven as soon as you start preheating), the pieces effortlessly brown. And instead of having to slice pristine planks—something I’ve never been able to pull off—we’ll give in to the craggy shape, tearing the Halloumi into nuggets.

    "title": "Typhoon Shelter Corn Ribs",
    "description": "The story goes that typhoon shelter dishes were first created on fishing boats housed in Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter. Most commonly made with freshly caught crab, these punchy stir-fries were served by boat dwellers entertaining customers who’d come to eat and drink on the fishing boats anchored in the cove. At their peak in the 1970s, there were reportedly more than 300 such tiny floating eateries, serving an iconic genre of fresh seafood cooked at high heat.The lively scene faded in the 1980s as the government ceased issuing licenses for boat restaurants and implemented schemes relocating most of the boat population to landside public housing. But the boat dwellers took their iconic typhoon shelter dishes with them, setting up restaurants and cooked food stalls around Wan Chai and beneath the Canal Road Flyover, thereby earning the iconic stir-fry style another name: Under the Bridge Spicy Crab.Today the original formula has gone through many permutations, and the same dish can taste quite different in different restaurants all over Hong Kong. For one, “typhoon shelter-style” has become a technique that can be applied to a myriad of ingredients, from shellfish to vegetables and even fried rice. Some chefs add breadcrumbs; others don’t. Some add chile in the form of Sichuan doubanjiang, some chili oil, and others fresh chiles. Some, as you see here, apply this technique to vegetables such as corn ribs. The common denominator, nevertheless, remains the sheer intensity of the dish: a whopping amount of minced and fried garlic, wok hei (the distinctly smoky flavor imbued on a dish from wok cooking), and a deep, sustaining, fiery spice that’s frankly uncharacteristic of Cantonese cuisine—a tradition most commonly known for its delicacy and clean flavors.Typhoon-shelter stir-fries aren’t easy to master. Much of the dish’s success is contingent on the management of heat. Undercooked garlic can be acrid yet a couple of seconds too long and it burns. Unevenly shaped ingredients may be hard to thoroughly cook and season through. Which is to say that excellent typhoon-shelter dishes aren’t to be missed on any trips to Hong Kong; the chef’s mastery of the wok is the key ingredient.To overcome those challenges at home, these corn ribs need to be blanched before they’re stir-fried. At the venerable Oi Man Sang, in Hong Kong, they’re blanched in oil, but at home water will do. Then the breadcrumb garlic crisp and the seasonings must be measured out before the stir-fry begins to minimize any risk of burning. As you would see in the Oi Man Sang episode in our Youtube Series Street Eats, the stir-fry portion of the recipe only takes a matter of seconds. There isn’t time for fuss. ",

    "title": "Siu Yuk (Cantonese Roast Pork)",
    "description": "When it comes to the most incredible Cantonese roast pork, the fact of the matter is that there really are no secrets. Fresh, local pork is butchered, seasoned with little more than salt and sugar, hung to marinate, pricked, and then roasted whole, often at one but sometimes two temperatures. From one perspective, the process is pretty simple: Season the pork and roast it. No top secret methods, no proprietary chemicals, no unexpected ingredients; it’s a technique as old as time.From another perspective, delicious Cantonese roast pork is only delicious as a result of experience. The hand of the chef, the familiarity of the oven, and the understanding of the pig coalesce into the transcendental experience we know as siu yuk. That’s what we travel for when we’re in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, hunting for that perfect bite.Back home, most of us aren’t seasoned Cantonese barbecue chefs. We also certainly don’t have the luxury of the underground infernal ovens like the ones you’ll find at Red Seasons in Hong Kong. We certainly wouldn’t have the space to roast whole hogs.However, that’s not to say that we need to compromise on quality roast pork. Even at home we should aim for the same standards of success that we hold our barbecue chefs to. First, thoroughly seasoned, well-cooked, succulent flesh. Second, skin that’s crispy but not hard. And finally, perhaps most importantly, sesame skin (芝麻皮)—small, even, sesame-sized blisters across the top of the skin.This recipe utilizes a whole host of techniques absent in most traditional Cantonese barbecue kitchens which, while not individually necessary, collectively lead to a satisfying homemade product. Trimmed, center-cut pork belly helps us achieve an even roast. The skin itself is blanched to kickstart the process of rendering fat, softening the skin, and converting the collagen into gelatin, which melts away in the heat. Then, small holes, poked all over the skin with a bundle of bamboo skewers, allow for the bubbles to form. Rubbing vodka onto the pork before it cures overnight helps the skin dry and puff as it cooks because alcohol evaporates faster than water as it cooks. Finally, the pork is roasted, initially at a low temperature for over a hundred minutes to encourage a gentle softening of the skin, then at a high temperature, broiling, to quickly expand small pockets of air under the skin, stretching the surface thin before firming and making the skin crispy.It’s a lot of work. For those of us living close to a quality Cantonese barbecue restaurant, I’m not entirely sure it’s worth the effort. However, there is something to be said about the deep satisfaction that comes from mastering a culinary challenge and that sense of gratification of creating something exquisite with your own hands. ",

I kept it a bit classic with plenty of freshly pressed apple cider (mine is from Mick Klüg Farm). Thankfully, their cider freezes perfectly, so the drink can be made any time of year. It can also be made in batches and then simply topped up with the soda water to serve.Admittedly, the burnt orange and rosemary can be a bit cumbersome, but the char really lends itself to the drink.

Her advice for parents everywhere? Start with something familiar to stir a little heat into. Condiments like peanut butter, cream cheese, or mayo are great vehicles for a spoonful of sriracha or chili paste. And a shining example of that is gado-gado—where sambal oelek is added to peanut butter to temper the heat.Gado-gado is one of Indonesia’s national dishes, found everywhere from food stalls, restaurants and family kitchens. This noodle-based version employs a combination of soy sauce and brown sugar as a substitute for kecap manis, a salty-sweet condiment often used to season the peanut sauce at the heart of the dish.

    "title": "Soy-Braised Chicken Legs",
    "description": "Despite being a staple at Cantonese barbecue restaurants, soy sauce chicken isn’t barbecued. Rather, it’s braised whole, in a fragrant stock of soy sauce and aromatics until gently cooked through, after which it’s rested, chopped, and served with ginger-scallion sauce.Though I use the word braise here, the Western convention of braising does not exactly describe the cooking method used on these whole chickens. For one, the birds are cooked at a relatively low temperature; in most restaurants, after the braising liquid is brought to a boil, the chickens are added with the heat off. This brings us to one translation of “soak.” But perhaps a more culturally faithful word would be lu in Mandarin, which describes the technique of gently poaching a wide variety of ingredients from meats to tofu in a master stock like the one for soy sauce chicken, called lushui. The defining characteristic of the master stock: The poaching liquid is deliberately reused for multiple cooks such that the poached ingredients contribute to the complexity of the stock itself, leading to accumulative, richer, deeper flavor. Some Chinese restaurants boast master stocks that are decades, even hundreds of years old.Most homes don’t have the luxury or the storage space required for such a master stock, or even a stock pot large enough to fit an entire chicken, so this recipe translates a similar flavor to a more approachable scope: the chicken leg. Though there is a loss in the ceremony of cooking a whole bird, cooking a chicken leg is also simpler in timing, as chicken legs need to cook to a higher internal temperature. To speed up the cooking further, deep incisions are made on both sides of the leg bone and across the joint until about halfway to expose the center of the flesh to the braising liquid.After a dry brine, boiling water is poured over the chicken legs in a sink. This tightens up the skin, preventing it from tearing as it braises, in a similar method to a quick blanch without the pomp and circumstance of bringing out a new pot. The chicken is then cooked gently in a simple stock of sautéed aromatics, soy sauce, and rose wine. Another key here is mushroom dark soy sauce, which has a higher molasses content and produces a shinier, glossier skin.And of course, remember that the master stock is the gift that keeps on giving. After cooled and strained, the poaching liquid—the lushui—can be reused for other ingredients or more chicken. ",

    "title": "Microwave-Steamed Fish",
    "description": "I don’t doubt that the mere suggestion of microwaving fish is enough to make the hairs on the back of the internet’s collective neck stand up in culinary protest.First and foremost: This recipe doesn’t stink up the microwave. The fish is wrapped in microwave-safe plastic wrap. (Use a high-sided plate so the wrap doesn’t directly touch the food.) Second of all, microwaves are spectacularly good at steaming. Unlike in a conventional steamer, which increases the air temperature surrounding the food, pushing the heat from outside in a microwaves generates heat inside out through vibrations of the water molecules within the ingredient. Because of this internal agitation, ingredients cooked in a microwave—including a nice fresh piece of fish—tend to cook more evenly, more quickly, and more cleanly.Achieving a uniformly and thoroughly steamed fish is particularly important for Cantonese steamed fish, the dish I would nominate as perhaps most emblematic of Hong Kong. The dish is the epitome of the Cantonese principle of cing taam (清淡), or delicacy, which celebrates balanced, subtle flavors. Especially with fish, the goal is to coax out the natural flavors of the cut, which means greater restraint with the ingredients: Ginger is added to temper any hints of gaminess, scallions to echo the sweetness, and soy sauce to elevate its savoriness. Hot oil is splashed over the top to activate those aromatics at high heat right before the dish hits the table.This recipe can apply to any white flaky fish, though the cooking time will vary based on the thickness of the fillet. So I advise starting at about 5 minutes and adding increments of 1 minute until the fish begins to flake. As always, the fresher the fish, the better the outcome, but the 15-minute dry cure here will help tighten the flesh of the fish, especially if the fillet had previously been frozen. If you’re unfamiliar with curing fish, this may initially seem like a lot of salt, but know that excess salt will be washed off thoroughly before cooking. ",

    "description": "Inspired by the flavors of qorma-e-sabzi, an Afghan spinach stew, this soup relies on frozen spinach and whatever fragrant herbs and alliums are lingering in the back of your fridge—a mix of parsley, cilantro, dill, or even scallions will work. Cooking the greens separately and adding them back in at the end ensures they stay vibrant; the simple aromatics and ground spices seasoning the lentil and rice base are bolstered by the verdant addition.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 10-oz. package frozen chopped spinach, thawed",
      "4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, divided",
      "½ cup finely chopped herbs (such as cilantro, parsley, and/or dill)",

    "title": "Cabbage and Bacon Okonomiyaki",
    "description": "A signature of Japanese street food, specifically of Osaka, okonomiyaki is a savory pancake known for its custardy interior and a bevy of finishing touches. While the traditional recipe features grated mountain yam (nagaimo or yamaimo) to nail the dish’s characteristically soft texture, this version approximates the results with a pantry-forward batter and a few cups of thinly sliced cabbage. Meanwhile, bacon makes a great extra-flavorful stand-in for the thinly sliced pork belly found in iterations all over Japan.This okonomiyaki recipe calls for instant dashi stock powder. If you don’t keep it on hand and want to save yourself a trip to the grocery store, we’ve offered a simple substitution: Just mix a bit of fish sauce with water to imbue the okonomiyaki batter base with a similar flavor. Next, to approximate Okonomi sauce—the sweet-savory condiment often drizzled over okonomiyaki alongside mayonnaise (if you have Kewpie mayo on hand, all the better)— doctor up your favorite ketchup with Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce.We like to dress this umami cabbage pancake with sliced pickled ginger and delicate bonito flakes, a.k.a. katsuobushi (both available at most Asian grocery stores or easily purchased online), plus fresh green onions. But feel free to raid your pantry for tenkasu, furikake, nori flakes, toasted sesame seeds, or anything else you’d care to sprinkle with abandon.",

    "title": "Manitou Stew With Dumplings",
    "description": "Half chowder, half fish pie, this one-pot dinner is everything I want contemporary Michigan cuisine to be—rooted in our region’s agricultural and culinary traditions but not stodgy or heavy the way Midwestern food is presented and perceived to be. The Manitou Islands are in Lake Michigan and part of the lore around Sleeping Bear Dunes in Glen Arbor, Michigan. This part of the state has the deepest tradition of smoked fish and mysticism around the lakes, so it only made sense to me to name it after them (plus it rhymes)!Smoked fish is emblematic of the northern Midwest both because many of the people who immigrated and stayed here were from fish-loving regions (Scandinavia, The Netherlands, and parts of the Mediterranean Basin), but also because our state’s defining (and unifying) feature, the Great Lakes, are loaded with all sorts of fish that were traditionally preserved through hot smoking.Note: The smoked fish takes the place of bacon, the cream is gone, and the amount of vegetables is doubled, differing from a more traditional chowder because that’s the way I like to eat. It is also a looser stew because the dumpling topping absorbs some of the broth. If you find that you miss the cream, go ahead and add a swirl before topping with the dumplings. Please also feel encouraged to mix and match the type of vegetables included to suit what is already in your kitchen or your preferences; there’s no need to go out hunting for rutabaga unnecessarily.",

    "title": "One-Pot Pantry Orzo With Chickpeas",
    "description": "This one-pot, pantry-friendly pasta is an invaluable addition to your repertoire. Whether you spent weeks traveling and are coming home to a near-empty fridge, or you simply can’t find the energy to whip up an elaborate meal, this recipe can be a crutch for those nights when your fridge is bare. Here fast-cooking orzo gets toasted in olive oil that’s infused with the punchy puttanesca-inspired flavors of garlic, capers, and green olives before cooking in a flavorful tomato broth amped up with dried oregano. Small pasta varieties like orzo are ideal for one-pot dishes as they will cook evenly in relatively small amounts of liquid. The starch they release as they cook adds a creaminess to the sauce for an effect similar to risotto. The whole thing comes together in under an hour and all in one pot, making it an ideal meal to whip up at a moment's notice. Serve with a scattering of fresh Parmesan and whole basil leaves if you have them.",

It was the dish he’d bring to “every birthday luncheon, barbecue, and graduation party.” With a bright and punchy sesame-ginger dressing plus tons of texture from bean sprouts, canned water chestnuts, and toasted nuts, it’s little surprise why this was beloved.

They aren’t finicky, travel well, and can be served warm, cold, or any temp in between. Plus, there’s very little more pure Michigan than finding another meal to add sour cream to!In our house we always have apples (thank you, prolific apple growers and a crop that stores for months on end) and make granola regularly, so I usually bake up a batch of these when I make that week’s granola. Note that you can make it with any dried fruit, but as a born-and-raised Michigander, I will always advocate for dried cherries. If you do bake the granola to just snack on throughout the week, add the fruit after baking so it doesn’t get leathery; when baked on the apples, the steam from the fruit cooking keeps the dried fruit soft.",

    "title": "Chimichurri",
    "description": "It’s no secret that we love green sauce, and this Argentine chimichurri recipe is no exception. For the best chimichurri, using fresh herbs is key. Our version combines fresh parsley, oregano, and cilantro, with a heavy pour of red wine vinegar, for a punchy condiment that’s as good spooned over grilled steak as it is drizzled on a bowl of lentils (it’s also an excellent marinade).Chopping everything by hand (as opposed to using a food processor) gives you dynamic texture—and prevents the herby sauce from turning into a paste. Allowing the shallot, chile, garlic, and salt to sit with the vinegar for 10 minutes before adding the herbs softens the aromatics and tames their raw sting.Chimichurri is best served just after it’s made, but the sauce will hold in the refrigerator for a few days. If you have any left over, use it to top roast chicken, grilled tofu, oven-roasted potatoes, fried eggs, or almost anything else that’s simply seasoned. Toss it with roasted veggies like a salad dressing. Mix it with Greek yogurt to create a dip, or work in a bit of mayonnaise for a creamy, herb-packed spread for sandwiches and tacos.",

    "title": "Japanese Cheesecake",
    "description": "There are three types of cheesecake commonly found in Japan: a baked variety similar to New York–style cheesecakes; an unbaked version set with gelatin; and soufflé-like Japanese cheesecakes such as this one. The last, sometimes called cotton cheesecake, is by far my favorite thanks to its fluffy texture and subtle lemon flavor that adds to its lighter-than-air personality.I’ve been baking jiggly soufflé cheesecakes my whole life, but I’ve recently revisited my recipe to perfect it. The key to nailing the dessert’s signature texture is in the meringue, which gets folded into a lightly sweetened cream cheese mixture. Whipping the egg whites in a chilled bowl protects against overbeating. Watch closely when you start to see soft peaks form: The meringue should droop ever so slightly, like a hook, when you upend the whisk. If the meringue is too stiff, you risk deflating the batter by overmixing. (Undermixing is preferred—a few wisps of unincorporated meringue are totally fine.) Rubbing lemon zest into the sugar unlocks the fruit’s fragrant oils and perfumes the batter with bright flavor. And, while salt is not typical of Japanese cheesecake recipes, a small addition here brings out the citrus even more.You’ll bake the cheesecake in a bain-marie, or hot water bath, to add steam. This helps regulate the oven temperature, preventing overbaking and cracks. If you don’t have a roasting pan, any heavy-duty rectangular baking pan will work—just make sure your cake pan fits inside it before you start.",

    "steps": [
      "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°. Bring 10 cups water to a boil in a kettle or medium saucepan and keep warm. Butter bottom and sides of springform pan with about half of ½ Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature. Line bottom of pan with a parchment paper round, then wrap a strip of parchment around sides; it should extend 1\" above the edges (like a collar; use 2 sheets for the sides if your parchment is not long enough.) Brush remaining butter on parchment along sides to coat (don’t coat the bottom). Generously dust sides with an even layer of powdered sugar, tapping out any excess. (Some powdered sugar on the bottom is okay.) Tightly cover outside of pan in several layers of foil to prevent water from seeping in.",
      "Combine 2 Tbsp. (25 g) granulated sugar and 1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest in a small bowl. Using your fingers, work zest into sugar until sugar starts to clump and mixture is very fragrant, about 1 minute. Set lemon sugar aside.",

      "Combine 8 oz. cream cheese and 1 cup whole milk in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high in 30-second bursts, stirring after each burst, until cream cheese is melted, about 2 minutes total; whisk until smooth. (Alternatively, heat cream cheese and milk in a small saucepan over low, whisking occasionally, until smooth, 5–7 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.)",
      "Add 4 large egg yolks and whisk until smooth. Add 1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. fresh lemon juice, reserved lemon sugar, and reserved dry ingredients and whisk again until smooth. Set cream cheese mixture aside.",

Add about one third (a scant 2 Tbsp.) of remaining ⅓ cup (67 g) granulated sugar and beat, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until sugar is dissolved and mixture is frothy (like the top of a latte), 1–2 minutes. Add half of remaining sugar (another scant 2 Tbsp.) and continue beating until sugar is dissolved and mixture is fluffy, 1–2 minutes. Add remaining sugar and beat until sugar is dissolved and meringue is glossy and thick and holds medium peaks (it should look marshmallowy), about 2 minutes.",
      "Add about one fourth of meringue to reserved cream cheese mixture and mix with a rubber spatula until combined. Add one third of remaining meringue and gently fold in, trying your best to avoid deflating meringue and overmixing.

    "title": "Basque Cheesecake",
    "description": "Burnt Basque cheesecake is the antithesis of American-style or New York cheesecakes. It wants to cook at a high temperature without the protection of a water bath. It wants to get browned and crack, to soufflé high and then deflate. It eschews a crust, instead forming its own where heat and surface area meet. In essence, all the things that make BA’s Best Cheesecake so great are the exact wrong things to do here. What does that mean? It’s virtually impossible to mess up this easy recipe.Molly Baz made a few tweaks to the famous version served at La Viña in Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain. She added a bit more flour to ensure the eggy cake’s center would set, dropped the sugar, and added some vanilla and salt. “The final recipe is jiggly and cloud-like, wet but not pudding-wet, burnt on purpose for a caramelized [surface], and barely sweet,” explains Alex Beggs. “Like a galette, it’s rustic and therefore perfectly imperfect. It forgives you for your sins. I need that kind of cheesecake in my life.” Don’t we all?Cream cheese is key to the rich cheesecake batter—you will need two pounds of it (that’s four packages of Philadelphia’s finest), and don’t try swapping in low- or non-fat versions. Be sure to remove the cake from the oven while the center still jiggles; it will continue to cook and then set as it cools. In keeping with the theme of simplicity, you can make this a day in advance and refrigerate it—just leave time for it to come up to room temp before serving.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 Unsalted butter (for pan)",
      "1½ lb. cream cheese, room temperature",
      "6 cups (300 g) sugar",
      "2 large eggs",
      "1 cups heavy cream",
      "1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "⅓ tsp. vanilla extract"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 400°. Brush pan with unsalted butter, then line with 2 overlapping 16x12\" sheets of parchment paper, making sure parchment comes at least 2\" above top of pan on all sides. Because the parchment needs to be pleated and creased in some areas to fit in pan, you won’t end up with a clean, smooth outer edge to the cake; that’s okay! Place pan on a rimmed baking sheet.",
      "Beat 2 lb. cream cheese, room temperature, and 1½ cups (300 g) sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed, scraping down sides of the bowl, until very smooth, no lumps remain, and sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes. (You can also use a large bowl with a hand mixer on medium low-speed, but you may need to continue beating for a few extra minutes to dissolve sugar.)",
      "Increase speed to medium and add 6 large eggs, one egg at a time, beating until each egg is incorporated, about 15 seconds, before adding the next. Scrape down sides of bowl, then reduce mixer speed to medium-low. Add 2 cups heavy cream, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and 1 tsp. vanilla extract and beat until combined, about 30 seconds.",
      "Turn off mixer and sift ⅓ cup (42 g) all-purpose flour evenly over cream cheese mixture using a fine-mesh sieve. Beat on low speed until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Scrape down sides of the bowl (yet again) and continue to beat until batter is very smooth, homogenous, and silky, about 10 seconds.",
      "Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cheesecake until deeply golden brown on top and still very jiggly in the center, 60–65 minutes.",
      "Let cool slightly (cake will collapse drastically as it cools), then unmold. Let cool completely. Carefully peel away parchment from sides of cheesecake. Slice into wedges and serve at room temperature, preferably with a glass of sherry alongside.",
      "Do Ahead: Basque cheesecake can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Let cheesecake sit at room temperature for several hours to remove chill before serving.",

    "title": "Cacio e Pepe",
    "description": "Along with carbonara and amatriciana, cacio e pepe is one of Rome’s essential pasta dishes, served at restaurants all over the Italian capital. Like many of the Eternal City’s best dishes, a good cacio e pepe recipe is about simplicity. Classic versions call for just pasta, salted water, freshly ground pepper, and Pecorino Romano, a Roman sheep’s milk cheese. Ours tosses a bit of Grana Padano or Parmesan into the mix for a more rounded cheese flavor that melds warmth, nuttiness, and sharpness. When combined properly, all the elements come together like sorcery into a lusciously cheesy dish with a creamy sauce.Ensuring this emulsified Italian pasta sauce is free of clumps when working the cheese into the starchy water can take practice. The quality of each ingredient is key: Use good butter and the best pasta you can afford and ensure your peppercorns are fresh. Classic cacio e pepe uses tonnarelli, a long pasta noodle that’s slightly thicker than spaghetti, but any long or short pasta works (think spaghetti, bucatini, rigatoni, or fettuccine). But the most important component is that cheese: Do not use pre-grated cheeses, which often include additives that prevent clumping in the bag but will cause clumping in your sauce. Use a box grater, not a fine Microplane, for coarsely grated cheese shreds that easily disperse and melt into the sauce without seizing up.  Cacio e pepe is best served immediately, so be sure to set your table before you start cooking. The dish needs little accompaniment, but a bright green salad is a nice addition to balance out the richness. And we'd never say no to garlic bread.Need a vegan version? Try this one.",

      "Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a 5-qt. pot over high heat. Season boiling water with kosher salt; add 6 oz. pasta (such as egg tagliolini, bucatini, or spaghetti) and cook, stirring occasionally, until about 2 minutes before tender. Drain, reserving ¾ cup pasta cooking water.",
      "Meanwhile, melt 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cubed, in a Dutch oven or other large pot or skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tsp. coarsely ground black pepper and cook, swirling pan, until toasted about 1 minute.",
      "Add ½ cup reserved pasta water to skillet and bring to a simmer. Add cooked pasta and remaining 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cubed. Reduce burner to low heat and add ¾ cup finely grated Grana Padano or Parmesan cheese, stirring and tossing with tongs until melted. Remove pan from heat; add ⅓ cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, stirring and tossing until cheese melts, sauce coats the pasta, and pasta is al dente. (Add more pasta water if sauce seems dry.)

    "title": "Fettuccine Alfredo",
    "description": "In the early 1900s, Italian restaurateur Alfredo Di Lelio started serving plates of pasta enrobed with cheese and butter at his restaurant in Rome. Known today as fettuccine Alfredo, the dish gained more fame in the past century in the US than in its home country. But it also evolved in its new environs: American cooks added heavy cream or half-and-half to thicken and enrich the sauce. To each their own, but no authentic fettuccine Alfredo recipe should include cream (because it dulls the flavor of the cheese).Like Roman staples cacio e pepe and pasta alla gricia, the gloss in Alfredo sauce comes from an emulsion of cheese with starchy pasta water (and, in this case, butter, which should be cold and cut into small pieces). It’s not a complicated technique, but it requires patience. The rich dairy must be introduced to the water slowly so that the elements can coalesce into that silky sauce. For extra guidance, check out this step-by-step video.The short ingredient list—pasta, butter, and Parmesan—means this is the place to be choosy, particularly with the cheese. Parmigiano-Reggiano (look for its name stamped on the side) is the classic choice and will absolutely give you the best flavor, but there are less expensive substitutes. Whatever you buy, choose a whole wedge and grate it coarsely yourself; or, pulse it in a food processor or blender (about five 30-second pulses should do it) to produce small beads of cheese that will melt evenly.To transform this simple pasta dish into chicken Alfredo, serve alongside a platter of tangy chicken piccata; or for shrimp Alfredo, make garlicky shrimp scampi.",

Bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat, then gradually whisk in ¼ cup (½ stick) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, no more than 1 Tbsp. at a time, until melted. Whisking constantly, gradually add ¾ cup (75 g) freshly grated Parmesan cheese, making sure it’s completely melted and incorporated before adding more.

    "title": "Olive Oil Cake",

One commenter proclaims: “This is the best dessert I have ever made, I can't stress enough how much everyone loves it—I could eat the entire cake.” Because olive oil is liquid at room temperature, it lends superior moisture to the crumb over time, meaning this cake improves as it sits on your counter for a few days—not that it will last that long, but it’s best to make it at least a day before serving.Be choosy about your olive oil here. “You definitely want a [high-quality] olive oil with ‘extra-virgin’ on the label, but you don’t have to shell out for fancy-shmancy single-estate stuff,” explains Antara Sinha. Lemon juice and zest in the cake batter will help pick up on a good quality olive oil’s fruity notes (for an olive oil cake that’s extra lemony, try this one). To drive home the oil’s flavor, you’ll reserve 2 tablespoons worth to drizzle on top after the warm cake comes out of the oven.This perfect little dessert needs little adornment, but if you’re making it for spring, spoon a pile of raspberries alongside and add a big dollop of whipped cream.

It’s bright from both lemon juice and zest, rich from an emulsion of Parmesan cheese, and fresh from the addition of big leaves of fresh basil.Chef-owner of Felix Trattoria, among other establishments, Funke believes pasta sauces should celebrate the craftsmanship of noodles (we chose spaghetti, but fettuccine, penne, or whatever pasta you’ve got on hand will be fine) rather than try to steal the spotlight. The citrusy lemon-asparagus pasta sauce does just that. The recipe requires very little prep time, so you can easily make this on a weeknight.Remove the woody ends from a bunch of fresh asparagus spears. We like thick asparagus here, sliced thinly on a deep diagonal so the pieces bend and twirl around your fork in concert with the pasta; if you can only find thin asparagus, slice the veggies into 1½\"–2\" pieces instead. You only want to sauté the asparagus for a moment so it retains its verdant hue—it will cook to crisp-tender when you start to work in the pasta water for the sauce.If fresh asparagus isn’t in season, skip the year-round asparagus and try a creamy one-pot pasta with frozen peas, mint, and black pepper; lemon zucchini pasta; or a straightforward pasta al limone.",

    "title": "Linguine With Meyer Lemon",
    "description": "Pairing lemon with pasta is just brilliant, as it lightens up what could be a very heavy dish. While the Northern Italian rendition uses a mix of cream and lemon juice, this pasta is coated in a silky butter sauce made with lemon zest as well as juice—it’s a bright, clean-flavored, lemony dish. Serve this in winter, when sweet, thin-skinned Meyer lemons are available and you start craving a comforting yet sunny-tasting dish like this. But don’t sweat it if you don’t have Meyer lemons; regular lemon sweetened with a squeeze of tangerine works beautifully in their place. We add a drizzle of olive oil—ideally a light, aromatic Ligurian oil—just before serving so that the fragrance of the warmed oil melds with the sauce. Our kids beg for this: When she was only two years old, Prue used to shout, “More lemon!”",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 lb. linguine",
      "6 Zest of 2 Meyer lemons",
      "½ Tbsp. (¾ stick) unsalted butter",
      "¼ tsp. freshly ground pepper",
      "½ Juice of 1 Meyer lemon"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Cook 1 lb. linguine in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until 2 minutes shy of al dente; drain.",
      "Transfer linguine to a large high-sided skillet or a Dutch oven, add ¼ cup water, and set over medium-low heat. Stir in zest of 2 Meyer lemons, 6 Tbsp. (¾ stick) unsalted butter, and ½ tsp. freshly ground pepper. Increase heat to medium and cook, tossing with tongs and adding a little more water if pasta seems dry, until butter is melted. Add juice of 1 Meyer lemon, ¼ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt and cook, tossing, until sauce thickens slightly and only a little liquid remains and pasta is al dente (increase heat to high if needed). Taste pasta and season with more salt if desired.",
      "Divide pasta among plates or shallow bowls. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and top with more Parmigiano-Reggiano, if desired."

    "title": "Brooklyn Blackout Cake",
    "description": "According to legend (a.k.a. the Internet), Brooklyn Blackout Cake was created by Ebinger’s bakery, a Flatbush-based storefront that once had outposts across New York’s boroughs, but eventually shuttered in 1972. Comprising three layers of very moist, tender devil’s food cake sandwiching a lush chocolate pudding and enrobed in a dark chocolate ganache-style frosting, Ebinger’s first called the dessert simply “chocolate fudge cake.” During World War II, the military began conducting controlled power outages along the Brooklyn waterfront, allowing battleships to leave the Brooklyn Navy Yard undetected. Notifications for these “blackout drills” were posted all over the borough, prompting Brooklynites to rechristen the beloved fudgy dark-crumbed cake.When the bakery closed, Ebinger’s original Brooklyn Blackout Cake recipe disappeared too. I wasn’t alive to have tried it, but—as any good chocolate cake fanatic would—I have a strong idea of how a cake named blackout should taste: rich, dark, moist, decadent...I could go on.Because assembling this cake is a little time-consuming, I wanted the sponge to be as easy as possible. My recipe starts with a simple chocolate cake enriched with Dutch-process cocoa powder and dark brown sugar (okay, so you should take the time to sift the dry ingredients since Dutch cocoa can be notoriously lumpy). It also has sour cream for richness—and to lift the chocolate flavor with its tang. You don’t need a stand mixer (or any other appliance); it’s just one bowl, dump, stir, and bake. The milky chocolate pudding filling is my favorite part of the recipe. It tastes like a richer, more chocolaty version of the pudding cups you might’ve found in your lunchbox as a kid. I’d make it as a stand-alone dessert anytime I need a quick chocolate fix. Because the cake and pudding are pretty sweet, I kept the frosting dark and moody. All you do is melt chocolate, stir in some cream, and let it thicken as it cools to room temperature. A dollop of sour cream adds just enough brightness for balance, while golden syrup gives the frosting a glossy sheen. Key to making Anzac biscuits (among other excellent baked goods), golden syrup can be hard to find in American grocery stores; swap it out for dark corn syrup if you must.Another important component of Brooklyn Blackout Cake is its garnish. You’ll bake the cake in two layers, then split each in half. Three of those layers are stacked with the pudding, but the fourth is crumbled and pressed into the sides of the cake for an arresting presentation that makes the dessert immediately identifiable. Putting the cake together can be a little messy: The pudding will smoosh out of the sides if you press down too hard or if it isn’t adequately chilled. But that’s the genius of the crumb coating. Once assembled, it’ll hide any and all flaws and no one will ever know what a crazy, oozy mess your naked cake once was.",
    "ingredients": [
      "¾ Unsalted butter, room temperature (for pans)",
      "1½ cup (63 g) Dutch-process cocoa powder, plus more for pans",

      "12 tsp. kosher salt",
      "¾ oz. bittersweet chocolate, chopped",
      "2 cup sour cream"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat oven to 350°. Line two 8x2\"-deep round cake pans with parchment paper. Grease with unsalted butter, then dust with cocoa powder, tapping out excess.",
      "Sift ¾ cup (63 g) Dutch-process cocoa powder, 1½ cups (187 g) all-purpose flour, 1½ tsp. baking soda, and ¾ tsp. baking powder into a medium bowl, then whisk to combine. Whisk 1 large egg plus 1 large egg yolk, room temperature, 1½ cups (packed; 320 g) dark brown sugar, ¾ cup sour cream, room temperature, 5 Tbsp. vegetable oil, 2 tsp. vanilla extract, ¾ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. plus ⅛ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and ¾ cup hot water in a large bowl until smooth. Whisk in dry ingredients until just combined.",
      "Divide batter between prepared pans. Bake cake until a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 25–35 minutes. Transfer pans to a wire rack; let cake cool completely in pan. Invert onto a plate, then invert again.",
      "Do Ahead: Cake can be baked 2 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.",
      "Whisk ⅓ cup (28 g) Dutch-process cocoa powder and 5 Tbsp. (35 g) cornstarch in a large saucepan. Whisk in 1¼ cups heavy cream until smooth and no lumps remain. Add 4 large egg yolks, beaten to blend, 1¼ cups whole milk, ⅔ cup (packed; 142 g) dark brown sugar, and ¼ tsp. kosher salt; whisk to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking occasionally, then reduce heat to low. Continue to cook, whisking, until thick and smooth, 1–2 minutes.",
      "Remove from heat; add 4 oz. milk chocolate, chopped and 1 tsp. vanilla extract and stir until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly onto surface of hot pudding to prevent a skin from forming. Chill until cold, at least 2 hours.",
      "Do Ahead: Pudding can be made 1 day ahead. Keep chilled.",
      "Bring 1 cup heavy cream, 3 Tbsp. golden syrup, and ⅛ tsp. kosher salt to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove from heat and stir in 12 oz. bittersweet chocolate, chopped, ¾ cup sour cream, and 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until chocolate and butter are melted and mixture is smooth and no streaks of white remain. Transfer to a medium bowl. Let frosting sit at room temperature, stirring every 30 minutes or so, until thickened and spreadable (it will look like a broken chocolate sauce at first, but magically, about 1½ hours later, it will start to thicken). Stir until smooth. (If your kitchen is warmer than 72°, chill frosting 5 minutes. Stir to combine cooler outer edges with warmer center, then chill another 5 minutes. It should be the consistency of sour cream; if not, chill another 5 minutes and stir.)",
      "Meanwhile, using a serrated knife and sawing in long, even strokes, carefully halve cakes lengthwise. Set aside the 3 prettiest layers for assembly. Crumble remaining layer of cake with your fingers into fine crumbs (or push through a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet). Place 1 layer, cut side up, on a platter or cake stand.",
      "Remove plastic from chilled pudding and vigorously whisk until smooth. Using a rubber spatula, spread half of pudding over cake layer on stand, spreading to edges. Top with another cake layer, cut side down, and spread remaining pudding over cake. Top with third cake layer cut side down (leave top bare). Chill cake 1 hour and up to 8 to let pudding firm up.",
      "Spread frosting all over top and sides of chilled cake. The frosting on top should be as smooth and level as possible, but it’s okay if the sides look messy; the chocolate cake crumbs will hide any mistakes you make.",
      "Place cake stand on a sheet tray. Take a handful of cake crumbs and press into sides of the cake. Repeat, turning cake as you go, to completely cover sides in crumbs. Sprinkle crumbs on outside edges of top layer.",
      "Do Ahead: Cake can be assembled 1 day ahead. Chill uncovered.",

    "title": "Sheet-Pan Chicken With Grapes and Fennel",
    "description": "Fennel and grapes are a classic pairing, lending any dish where they appear together a vaguely Tuscan air. Here they are roasted alongside bone-in chicken thighs until tender and juicy (and the seasoned chicken skin is nicely crisp), then topped with a scattering of buttery, briney green olives and the feathery fennel fronds. Torn pieces of crisped-up sourdough are the best part of this sheet-pan dinner. When soaked in a mixture of smoky chicken and burst grape juices, the big, flavorful croutons will be the first to disappear.Hangry waits for no one. Especially not test kitchen editor Kendra Vaculin. In Speedy Does It, she’s sharing whoa-worthy dinners you can get on the table like *snaps fingers* that.",
    "ingredients": [
      "½ loaf sourdough bread (about 10 oz.), torn into 2\" pieces",

    "description": "This is for those of us who douse our chicken pot pie in hot sauce when no one is looking. A little heat from canned green curry paste and a generous splash of lime juice put a bright spin on this familiar comfort food. We highly recommend Maesri brand curry paste for its balanced heat and aromatic warmth. Don’t have green or just want to switch things up? Red or yellow curry paste are easy swaps. Cooking skinless, boneless chicken breasts from scratch, rather than tearing up a rotisserie chicken, is a small effort to make for the payoff: big chunks of juicy meat that feel substantial and satisfying.",

    "title": "Dahi Bhalla With Tamarind Chutney",
    "description": "Holi is the Hindu festival of colors and welcomes the arrival of spring in India. There are many delicacies that are prepared during the celebrations, but one is particularly special: dahi vada, also known as dahi bhalla. This is a beloved Indian snack of fermented lentil dumplings that are fried until golden brown, then soaked in seasoned yogurt. Dahi vada is served as a cooling snack on a hot afternoon, hitting all the tangy, sweet, and sour notes that are so quintessential to chaat dishes.Soak the urad dal for a minimum of five hours to ensure that it blends into a smooth paste. This dal paste can get quite tacky, so adding water helps loosen it for blending. The texture of the dumplings is soft, light, and airy; once topped with and soaked in the yogurt, they achieve a delightfully spongy quality.This spicy, flavorful dish might be a mainstay of Holi, but it makes for a vibrant party snack year-round. Dahi vada is typically garnished with various chutneys, like tamarind and cilantro-mint, and spices like chaat masala and red chile powder. There are many varieties that differ slightly from one another. Some versions include potatoes and chickpeas as a topping; others feature tomatoes and crispy sev. I grew up eating this simple version, and it hits the spot every time.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup urad dal",
      "3 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. plus 3¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided",

      "2 cup tamarind purée"

      "Rinse 1 cup urad dal in a fine-mesh sieve and place in a medium bowl. Pour in room-temperature water to cover and soak until dal is softened, at least 5 hours and up to 12 hours.",
      "Drain dal and transfer to a blender. Add 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt and ½ cup water and blend until smooth. (Take a pea-size amount of purée between your fingers and rub to ensure it is not grainy and there are no chunks; blend longer if needed.) Transfer purée to a container with enough space for mixture to rise. Cover loosely with plastic wrap or a lid, place in an oven proofer set at 115°, and let ferment until double in size, 3–4 hours. (Alternatively, proof in your oven set to 115° or lowest setting or proof in a really warm spot in your kitchen.)",

Cook, pushing down, pouring oil over, and turning (this will ensure they puff up and are hollow in the center), until deep golden brown, 9–11 minutes. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer vadas to paper towels and let drain.",
      "Combine 3 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. plus 2¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt and 4 quarts hot water in a large bowl. Add vadas and let soak until rehydrated, pale, and only slightly firm, about 30 minutes. Working one at a time, remove vadas from water and press in your hand to release water (they will break slightly and flatten). Transfer to a baking sheet.",

    "title": "Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake",
    "description": "With two layers of fluffy sponge and swooshes of fudgy frosting, this picture-perfect gluten-free chocolate cake recipe looks almost too good to be true. But this layer cake? She delivers. Her trick? Skip the store-bought all-purpose flour alternative and make your own gluten-free flour blend using nutty oat flour (which is naturally high in protein, providing structure), starchy sweet rice flour (to keep the crumb tender), and xanthan gum (to hold it all together).While you could make oat flour by blitzing rolled oats in your food processor, we found commercial oat flours work best here (we like Bob’s Red Mill). Factory-milled flours tend to have a finer texture than their homemade counterparts, allowing them to absorb moisture more evenly, translating to a softer, fluffier cake.To develop rich chocolate flavor and color, you’ll bloom unsweetened cocoa powder (Dutch-process, please) in hot water. Meanwhile, tangy buttermilk (or a baker-approved buttermilk substitute) brings out the chocolate’s bright, fruity notes. As for the pudding-like chocolate frosting, its texture lies somewhere in the Venn diagram of whipped cream, buttercream, and chocolate ganache. It’s also virtually indestructible; any problem you may encounter is fixable. Too soft? Chill it. Too firm? Let it sit at room temperature for a while longer. Looking split? Warm it gently until it smooths out.For the best presentation, baking these in 8\" round cake pans is imperative. Use 9\" pans instead and the cake layers will be too thin and anemic-looking. And when you’re making a birthday cake (or any occasion cake) for someone who’s had their fair share of celiac-conscious catastrophes, you want to get everything just right.

Caramelizing the kimchi in butter tempers its funky, fermented flavor, while gochujang brings sweet, fruity heat. Add chicken broth and kimchi juice to the pan and let all the flavors concentrate, resulting in a slightly spicy udon sauce with deep complexity.When you’re ready to dive in, use your chopsticks to pierce the egg yolk and let the velvety cascade coat the noodles. But feel free to forgo if you’re squeamish about raw egg yolks.",

    "title": "Lemony White Bean Soup",
    "description": "We love canned beans as much as the next weeknight dinner warrior, but when beans are the main attraction (as in this lemon-scented white bean soup recipe), you can’t beat the depth of flavor you get by starting with dried. Use creamy cannellini beans, hearty navy beans (a.k.a. white kidney beans), or even big boi gigante beans, but avoid Great Northern beans, which have a mild flavor and are better suited to dressing up as baked beans. Whatever you choose, soak the dried beans overnight and drain the water. (Conscious of your water footprint? Use the excess liquid to water your houseplants.)We call upon the power of a food processor to make quick work of the aromatics (a mix of diced onion, celery, garlic, and lemon zest), but if you want to avoid lugging it out, chop the vegetables finely by hand before you sauté them in oil, then add in the Microplaned lemon zest. We’ve kept this soup vegetarian, but chicken stock or broth is an easy stand-in for the vegetable broth if preferred. And once you’ve got your pot going, you can have a little fun: Add in a sprig of fresh rosemary, oregano, or parsley; or a few bay leaves. Love heat? A pinch of crushed red pepper flakes goes a long way. Craving umami? Submerge a Parmesan rind in the broth while the creamy white beans bubble away. Or just leave as is for a simple, satisfying bowl of comfort food.To finish, a knob of butter goes in the pot, adding richness and a rounded flavor, along with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice for brightness. We like this bean soup a little brothy, but if you’re craving something with more body, grab an immersion blender and purée a portion of the soup to thicken it. Garnish with a sprinkle of fragrant herbs or a grating of Parmesan cheese and serve with crusty bread for a captivating soup that eats like a warm, cozy hug.",

Here that recipe’s building blocks are reimagined as a ragù, with ground chicken, aromatics, and a dollop of sour cream swirled in for richness.Two notes for shopping. If you can find dark meat ground chicken, definitely grab it; dark meat has more fat than white meat, which is welcome in a ragù (traditionally made with pork or beef, both with higher fat content than chicken). And in the spice aisle, seek out Hungarian paprika, which is very bright red and more flavorful than “sweet paprika” or just “paprika” (though either will do in a pinch). The only variety to avoid here is smoked, or Spanish, paprika, which will provide a different flavor profile and a much darker color to your finished pasta.",

    "description": "Jam and Dijon mustard is an IYKYK kind of situation. While the duo may seem an unlikely pair, fated to meet only when stored next to each other in the fridge, they actually belong together as the building blocks of a delightfully tangy sauce. Consider this: You get sweetness and body from the jam and brightness and acidity from the mustard. Add a bit of soy sauce for savory saltiness and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes for heat and you’re in business, without ever looking beyond what you probably already have stocked in your kitchen.In this recipe, sharp Dijon and your jam of choice (I love the rich color you get from raspberry but any flavor works) make up the base of a topping for pork tenderloin. This quick-cooking cut is ideal for weeknight dinners. After searing the pork in a hot pan, you’ll build the sauce and then nestle the meat back in, to finish cooking as the fruity mixture thickens. The glaze also pulls double duty as a component for the vinaigrette that is drizzled over a simple salad of delicately bitter radicchio and quick-pickled red onion. It all makes for a flavor-packed 35-minute meal with minimal shopping required.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 medium red onion, thinly sliced",

    "description": "It may not have occurred to the powers that be that February, the month when Valentine’s Day takes place, is a terrible time for strawberries. And yet they’re everywhere around the holiday, presumably because of their ruby color and heart-like shape. Unfortunately, biting into an overpriced chocolate-dipped berry that’s bright white on the inside is not the stuff of great romance. These cream puffs solve the problem by spinning those classic flavors into a new dessert—one that can be made any time of year, thanks to strawberry ice cream and strawberry jam.Pâte à choux is deceptively simple, even if it's your first time. With no special equipment required, all you need are a few ingredients and the buns will puff up tall and golden. On the off chance yours do deflate, have no fear: These babies get cut in half, filled, and covered in chocolate, hiding any perceived imperfections.With a romantic evening in mind, this recipe yields two cream puffs, with two extra buns for another day. You can freeze the unbaked dough and bake later on from frozen. Or, bake all four and use the surplus for breakfast in bed the next morning, filled with scrambled eggs and cheese. Or, if you're making dessert for four, simply double the filling and assembly ingredients.",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces",
      "1 Tbsp. granulated sugar",
      "½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "½ cup (63 g) all-purpose flour",
      "2 large eggs, room temperature, beaten to blend",
      "¾ cup heavy cream, divided",
      "1 tsp. powdered sugar",
      "2 oz. bittersweet chocolate, chopped",
      "½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "4 Tbsp. strawberry jam (such as Bonne Maman), divided",
      "2 Strawberry ice cream (for serving)"
    ],

      "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425°. Bring 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces, 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar, ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and ¼ cup plus 3 Tbsp. water in a medium saucepan to a boil, stirring to encourage butter to melt, and sugar and salt to dissolve. Immediately reduce heat to medium-low and add ½ cup (63 g) all-purpose flour all at once. Stir gently with a wooden spoon until most of the flour is absorbed, then cook, stirring vigorously and breaking up pockets of flour as needed, until a thin film forms on bottom and sides of pan and dough comes together into a single mass, 2–3 minutes. (The dough should look glossy and feel buttery-slick to the touch.) Transfer dough to a small bowl and spread up the sides with spoon (this will encourage it to cool faster). Let sit until cooled slightly but still warm to the touch, 3–5 minutes.",
      "Pour half of 2 large eggs, room temperature, beaten to blend, into the center of bowl with dough. Using a fork, mix until combined, then add remaining egg and mix again to combine. Using a rubber spatula, scrape any dough from fork, then vigorously mix dough with spatula until very smooth, glossy, and a little stretchy (pull spatula vertically out of the dough; the dough should fall off the end in a V shape).",
      "Using a spoon, scoop out a generous amount of dough (you want about a quarter of the dough). Holding spoon perpendicular to a parchment-lined baking sheet, scrape dough off spoon with another spoon so it drops onto pan. Repeat with remaining dough to create 3 more cream puffs, leaving a generous space around each. Scrape out and evenly distribute any remaining bits of dough left in the bowl among puffs. Dip your index finger into a bowl of water and use it to gently pat down any pointy bits of dough (they will burn in the oven if not smoothed out).",
      "Bake cream puffs 10 minutes, then decrease oven temperature to 350° and continue to bake 15 minutes more. (Do not open the oven door at any point during baking.) Transfer to a wire rack and immediately poke a small hole into each cream puff with a skewer, chopstick, or paring knife to let the steam escape. Let cool.",
      "While the cream puffs are cooling, whisk ½ cup heavy cream and 1 tsp. powdered sugar in a small bowl until stiff peaks form. Cover and chill until ready to assemble cream puffs.",
      "Microwave 2 oz. bittersweet chocolate, chopped, ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and remaining ¼ cup heavy cream in a microwave-proof bowl on high in 30-second bursts, stirring after each burst, until melted—be careful not to burn; it should look similar to hot fudge. (Alternatively, you can heat in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, stirring, until melted. Do not let bowl touch water.) Set ganache aside.",
      "Using a serrated knife, gently slice 2 cream puffs in half through the equator. Place each on a plate and divide 4 Tbsp. strawberry jam between bottom halves of cream puffs; spread into an even layer. Place a generous scoop of strawberry ice cream on top of jam on each cream puff. Dollop whipped cream over ice cream (use as much or as little as you like), then close up cream puffs. Pour reserved warm ganache over each cream puff as desired and sprinkle each with half of 2 Tbsp. crushed freeze-dried strawberries if using.",
      "Do Ahead: Dough can be formed 1 month ahead. Freeze cream puffs on a baking sheet until frozen, then transfer to a resealable plastic freezer bag. Bake from frozen, adjusting baking time to 15 minutes at 400° and 20 minutes at 350°. (You can also thaw in the refrigerator overnight and bake as directed)."

    "title": "Spicy Miso Tuna Noodle Casserole",
    "description": "This is the tuna noodle casserole that changed the mind of more than one tuna noodle skeptic in the Bon Appétit test kitchen. “I can actually see myself eating this,” said Chris Morocco, food director and certified hater of hot canned tuna. A rousing endorsement from someone who considers a tuna melt to be an abomination. And therein lies the charm of this particular version of the casserole: its ability to appeal to doubters and hard-core fans alike. The additions of miso, chili sauce, and soy sauce sharpen everything without detracting from the comforting elements of a classic tuna casserole—creamy sauce, melty cheese, and twirly pasta. Chicken bouillon paste, rather than boxed broth, provides a more umami-dense flavor wallop. And where one normally might use heavy cream or canned cream of mushroom soup for the sauce, a brick of cream cheese comes in handy, melting gently into a velvety mess, with a hint of tang. Be sure to secure tuna in oil (we love Sea Tales and Starkist); it’s more rich and meaty than tuna preserved in water. If spicy tuna rolls and a potato-chip-topped casserole had a baby, this would be it.",

    "title": "Puffy Tacos With Picadillo",
    "description": "If you haven’t been to San Antonio,, you can be forgiven for not knowing about the city’s culinary mascot: the puffy taco. It was introduced to the city in 1982 by Arturo Lopez at Ray’s Drive Inn, a restaurant he bought from his brother Ray. This is not a hard-shell taco, nor is it a regular soft taco, explains writer and Texan Priya Krishna. “The puffy taco occupies an ideal middle ground between the two. The outside is delicate and crispy, dotted with hot bubbles of air that form in the fryer; the inside is juicy and dense.” Unlike a flatter, denser tostada, the tortilla for a puffy taco is manipulated while frying to create a boat shape you can fill with various mix-ins. Eating one is all about the balance of textures between the taco filling and the shell.While some puffy taco recipes start with fresh masa dough and a tortilla press, this one from Superica in Atlanta, keeps things simple by frying store-bought corn tortillas in hot oil to make the puffy taco shells. To achieve the trademark steam pockets, be sure your tortillas are fresh.When it comes to toppings for these beef tacos, follow Superica’s lead with lettuce, shredded cheese, diced tomatoes, and cilantro, or choose your own adventure with additions like guacamole, sour cream, and pickled jalapeños.",

Add ½ small onion, finely chopped, 1 small Yukon Gold potato, peeled, finely chopped, 1 small carrot, peeled, finely chopped, 1 small poblano chile, finely chopped, and 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced; cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is golden and soft, 8–10 minutes. Season with kosher salt, add ⅓ cup chili powder, and cook, stirring, until chili is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 2 lb. ground beef chuck (20% fat) and cook, breaking up meat with the back of a spoon and scraping up any browned bits from pot, until meat is browned, 12–15 minutes. Stir in 2 cups Pico de Gallo or other salsa; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until most of liquid evaporates and beef is tender, 15–20 minutes. Season beef picadillo with kosher salt.",
      "Meanwhile, pour oil into a medium heavy pot to come 3\" up the sides; fit with thermometer. Heat over high until thermometer registers 375°. Holding one of 8 corn tortillas perpendicular to the oil near the edge of the pot, carefully lower into the oil so that the tortilla slides to the bottom (this method will fry and seal both sides of the tortilla, allowing steam to inflate—or “puff”—the tortilla like a balloon). After a few seconds, the puffy tortilla will float to the surface; turn over and push the top edge of a metal spatula (a fish spatula works best) into the center of the tortilla, bending it into a taco shape, and press it below the oil’s surface. Hold in place and cook until the indentation is set and the shell is golden brown and crisp, about 1 minute. Invert taco shell on paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining tortillas.",
      "Spoon beef picadillo into shells and top with shredded iceberg lettuce, chopped tomatoes, grated sharp cheddar cheese, and chopped cilantro. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing.Do Ahead: Beef picadillo can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat before serving. Editor’s note: This puffy taco recipe was first printed in our November 2015 issue. Head this way for more great taco recipes, available on the Epicurious app →"

    "title": "Pasta With Feta, Olives, and Raisins",
    "description": "When dinnertime looms and inspiration is scarce, this pantry pasta will be there for you. Raisins make an unlikely starring appearance; they swell and plump in the pasta cooking liquid and balance the briny intensity of the feta and chile-oil-sizzled olives. (Feel free to skip the anchovies if you want to make it vegetarian.) A handful of parsley to finish and you’ll soon see that you really don’t need to be stocked to be well fed.",
    "ingredients": [

    "title": "Chapatis",
    "description": "While naan (please don’t call it naan bread) gets most of the glory outside of India, there are many varieties of Indian bread, like aloo paratha, puri, and thepla. Chapati, an everyday flatbread sometimes called roti, is a staple of north Indian cooking and you’ll find versions across the cuisines of Southeast Asia, East Africa, and the Caribbean. Like tortillas, they are incredibly versatile.Some chapati recipes call simply for water and chapati flour or atta, the Hindi word for finely milled wheat flour; others add a little oil or ghee and salt. This one from the late chef Rebecca Collerton, who served chapatis at her popular Brooklyn pop-up, Mr. Curry, uses a mix of flours and swaps the oil for yogurt to create a soft dough. If you keep conventional whole wheat flour on hand, it’ll work fine, but for authentic homemade chapatis, seek out sharbati atta, a high-gluten variety.Collerton’s technique is simple: Letting the dough rest is an essential part of the prep time; it allows the glutens to relax, so don’t rush it. Chapatis are traditionally cooked on a griddle called a tawa, but a cast-iron skillet works well; if you have a stovetop griddle, you can make several at a time. When cooking chapatis, look for a few brown spots on one side before flipping the flatbreads over. For added richness, slick them with ghee.Serve with Sweet-and-Sour Tomato Chutney, Curried Meatballs, Beet and Carrot Salad with Curry Dressing and Pistachios, Spiced Rice, and Scallion-Herb Yogurt Sauce.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup (120 g) whole wheat flour",
      "1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting",
      "¼ cup plain yogurt",
      "1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1½ tsp. Morton kosher salt"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Whisk 1 cup (120 g) whole wheat flour and 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add ¼ cup plain yogurt, 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and ¾ cup water. Mix with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.",
      "Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding more all-purpose flour as needed, until dough is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky, 8–10 minutes. Dust with more all-purpose flour, wrap in plastic, and let rest at least 1 hour at room temperature.",
      "Divide dough into 12 pieces. Working with 1 dough ball at a time and keeping the other pieces covered with plastic wrap, roll out on a lightly floured surface to 8\" rounds (if dough springs back when rolled, let rest a few minutes before proceeding).",
      "Heat a dry large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-high heat. Cook a round of dough until lightly charred in spots and browned in others, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining rounds.Do Ahead: Chapatis can be cooked 45 minutes ahead. Wrap in foil and keep warm in a 250° oven. Editor’s note: This recipe for chapatis was first printed in our January 2016 issue. Head this way for more of our favorite bread recipes →"

Yes, the now ubiquitous (and often unfulfilling) “replacement” for rice creates the ideal base for these flavorful, moreish fritters, removing the frozen staple from its low-carb confines and allowing its true culinary merits to shine. Here the riced cauliflower is mixed with tender herbs, garlic, Parmesan cheese, and breadcrumbs to create a meatball-like mixture that gets formed into patties and fried until crisp and golden. Paired with a zippy lemon yogurt and scattered with sliced red onions and even more herbs, they make an ideal vegetarian dinner.",

Whisk the vinegar mixture with Dijon mustard, honey, and olive oil until thick. Adjust to taste—an extra drizzle of honey to pull out the raisins’ sweetness perhaps, or another splash of the seasoned vinegar for a bit more brightness.

(Plus, you can make exactly what you’re craving, even if it’s no longer peak season.) Already peeled, pitted, and sliced peaches take a delicious turn when cooked with golden brown, crispy skin-on chicken thighs, lending their delightful sweetness to a rich and tangy pan sauce.

    "title": "Berbere Kabocha With Brown Butter Peanuts and Lime",
    "description": "This is a vegetable dish so spectacular, it would be a shame to call it a side. Squash is generously seasoned with berbere, then baked until golden and tender. Serve these wedges over tangy yogurt, then top it all off with brown butter peanuts with a jolt of lime juice. Add a loaf of bread and you have a party.Berbere is an Ethiopian spice blend typically composed of red chile powder, fenugreek, ginger, coriander, cardamom, allspice, cumin, peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon. It’s a versatile way to bring a warm kick to meat, vegetables, and legumes. It works especially nicely with kabocha squash, which is dense enough to hold up to the intensity of the berbere, while also imparting its own sweetness. But this recipe will work just as well with acorn or delicata varieties.The hardest part about this recipe is slicing the kabocha squash, so be sure to set yourself up for success. First, place a wet kitchen or paper towel under your cutting board so it’s not sliding around. Next, use a sharp chef’s knife and begin with the pointed tip, starting near the stem. This will ensure that your knife doesn’t get stuck in the squash—a situation many of us have found ourselves in. You got this!",

    "title": "Spiced Beef Taco Bowls",
    "description": "“Keep it simple, Susan.” That’s the theory behind this fast and fantastic beef taco bowl recipe. Who’s Susan? We don’t know. But she needed a quick dinner, so now you benefit too.For ease, we rely on a trusty Tex-Mex seasoning packet to flavor the taco meat. Prefer homemade taco seasoning? More power to you. The main players are cumin, oregano, and chili powder; if you have them in your pantry, mix away. A food processor does fast work of mincing the sofrito ingredients (onion, jalapeño, garlic); if you don’t have one, a blender works too—or you can take a few extra minutes to chop everything finely by hand. Beef not your vibe? Swap in ground turkey, chicken, or pork. Or make a batch of refried black beans or spiced tofu for a vegetarian version.Similarly, you should use whatever base you like. We’re partial to plain long-grain white rice (keep it simple, Susan), but brown rice, quinoa, or cauliflower rice work equally well. Overachiever? Cilantro-lime rice is calling your name. Or, if you forgot about the grains entirely, throw down some lettuce and call it a taco salad instead.For garnishing, we like a straightforward pico de gallo, but these are your taco bowls, so set up a bar with cheddar cheese, sour cream, guacamole, pickled onions, fresh cilantro, hot sauce, and any other add-ins you like. The one nonnegotiable: crispy tortilla chips. Without them, this is nothing but a burrito bowl (yes, that’s the only difference).All of the components for these taco bowls are super meal-prep-friendly: Refrigerate the salsa and spiced beef separately in airtight containers, keep a stash of your favorite toppings on hand, and assemble when ready for a swift lunch or easy dinner.",

If you only have pre-ground coriander, you can use it in both places; the fine grind will make an even smoother sauce, but you’ll miss out on some texture on the fish.

    "description": "There’s something about these hearty flourless oatmeal cookies that hits just right. They have a homespun appeal that says, “I’m wholesome enough to eat for breakfast—but decadent enough to satisfy as dessert.” Jammed with mix-ins including dried sour cherries, rich chunks of dark chocolate, crunchy toasted pecans, and a rounding hit of warm cinnamon, it’s a gluten-free oatmeal cookie that just may take the place of your go-to version.To make up for the loss of the all-purpose flour found in a traditional oatmeal cookie recipe, we blitzed a portion of the oats into a powder, which ramps up the cookies’ chewiness, adds an additional layer of nutty flavor, and gives the cookie dough just enough structure. In a departure from traditional baking advice against overworking, it is actually advisable to vigorously mix gluten-free batters and doughs, like these cookies. Doing so improves the texture by ensuring the xanthan gum (an ultrafine powder used often to thicken and bind gluten-free doughs) is both fully hydrated and well dispersed.",

    "title": "Paloma",
    "description": "The paloma epitomizes the no-fuss summer cocktail ethos, balancing sweet, sour, and salty notes while packing a boozy punch—and the iconic Mexican drink comes together in just a minute or two. The Spanish name “la paloma” translates to “the dove” (and perhaps making one will bring you some peace), but some suggest the origin of this tequila cocktail’s name is related to the similar-sounding “pomelo,” Spanish for grapefruit and the flavor at the heart of the drink.To serve a paloma cocktail in its simplest form, a host may leave out a bottle of tequila, some grapefruit sodas like Squirt or Jarritos, and lime wedges, and have guests pour their own. For a brighter grapefruit flavor, this paloma recipe swaps the soda for fresh juice and sparkling water, plus your sweetener of choice, allowing you to rein in each element as you please. In keeping with the ease of the classic version, you’ll still build the drink in the glass you intend to drink it from—meaning, you won’t need a cocktail shaker, and making a big batch is as easy as scaling up each ingredient.For the alcohol base, tequila is more common, but few have ever said “no” to a mezcal paloma. If your home bar needs restocking, consider Pueblo Viejo for blanco tequila and Sombra or Vida for mezcal. Make another round or a slew of other tequila drinks with the leftovers, like a margarita or siesta.",

    "title": "Ginger Fried Rice",
    "description": "Made with just a few ingredients, this fried rice is highly aromatic thanks to a heavy dose of fresh ginger. In traditional Chinese medicine, ginger is a key ingredient in postpartum care and is believed to help balance the body’s yin and yang (cold and heat), restoring the heat lost during childbirth. More widely, ginger is used to aid digestion and treat stomach upset and nausea, so consider this recipe as a pick-me-up when feeling poorly. While many fried rice recipes include garlic; this one does not because I don’t ever use garlic in my fried rice, and there are purported theories that garlic may alter the breast milk and cause babies to be colicky.While ginger is the undeniable star of this dish, you can vary the amount to your liking. For optimum bright flavor and warmth, it is added to the skillet after the rice and cooked minimally (the longer ginger cooks, the sweeter it gets). While the recipe calls for a cast-iron skillet, a wok can certainly be used—just skip the step where the rice is cooked undisturbed to crisp up. The wok will accomplish this naturally due to its larger surface area.As always for fried rice, cold leftover rice is best, but if you need to make rice from scratch, here’s what to do: Cook the rice, let it cool about 10 minutes, then transfer to a baking sheet and spread out into a single layer. Let cool 10–20 minutes more before chilling, uncovered, 1–2 hours. The cool air of the fridge dries out the rice, rendering it more suitable for frying.",

    "title": "Negroni",
    "description": "A classic negroni is the original 1:1:1 cocktail (equal parts gin, sweet vermouth, and Campari). “But here’s the problem,” argues former BA editor Julia Kramer, “Equal-parts cocktails don’t always taste so good—palates have evolved since these ratios were codified.” The team at Chiltern Firehouse in London, who created this variation on that classic cocktail recipe, agrees. They tweaked the ratios for modern palates, creating a gin-forward version of the drink to keep the bittersweet Italian aperitivo Campari in check. Sweet, a.k.a. red, vermouth is the third player here, and it’s worth splurging on a good bottle: We like Carpano Antica Formula for its vanilla notes and dry finish, but Punt e Mes or Cocchi Storico are also good choices.There’s no shortage of negroni riffs out there. Most famous among them is the sbagliato (of “negroni sbagliato…with prosecco in it” fame), which swaps the gin for sparkling wine—think of it as the halfway point between a spritz and a negroni. There’s also the white negroni with Lillet Blanc and a pleasantly bitter French apéritif called Suze; and a boozy punch version of the cocktail with gin and prosecco. You can also play around with other aperitifs: Swap the Campari for lighter Aperol or herbal Génépy. For a wintry vibe, use bourbon in place of the gin, and you’ll have a boulevardier. Want a low-ABV version? Swap out the gin for soda water and the orange peel for a lemon wedge and you’ll have an Americano.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1½ oz. dry gin",

    "title": "Maple-Glazed Carrots",
    "description": "These maple-roasted carrots are the glaziest side dish you’ll ever eat, their sweet-hot kick complementing everything from ham to lamb to green bean casserole. Bonus: The easy recipe requires minimal prep time, making it a strong choice for a lazy weekend supper or holiday dinner—whether for Easter, Rosh Hashanah, Christmas, or Thanksgiving.Leave the baby carrots for another day and look for long, slender whole carrots without many cracks, ideally with their green tops still attached. The candy-like glaze plays up the root vegetable’s natural sweetness, while a dash of chile flakes keeps the cooked carrots in check. Note that the glaze can make a mess of a sheet pan, so line it well with foil (not parchment paper) for easy cleanup. Roasting in a single layer in a hot oven helps ensure caramelized, fork-tender glazed carrots with lightly crispy edges; keep an eye on them as they near the end of the cooking time since that sugar can darken quickly. Adding a bit of flaky salt as a final garnish balances the sweetness, but if you prefer a hit of something fresh, add a shower of roughly chopped fresh herbs like parsley or oregano—or those carrot greens.Need something faster for your weeknight dinner?

    "title": "BA’s Best Buttermilk Biscuits",
    "description": "If you’re looking for clues to a winning homemade buttermilk biscuit recipe, you won’t find them in the ingredients list. That should always be simple. The real secret for making the best biscuits—ones with crispy, golden brown tops, tender middles, and a bounty of buttery, flaky layers—lies in the technique. And this easy biscuit recipe from pastry expert Claire Saffitz is all about technique. (Catch Claire making the biscuits.)It hinges on keeping your prep time short and your dairy as chilly as possible. If your kitchen runs warm, toss the butter slices in the freezer for at least 30 minutes and then add the frozen butter straight to your food processor. (No food processor? A pastry cutter or even a fork works fine, but you may want to chill your flour too to avoid overmixing your dough.) Cold buttermilk is also essential; even if you’re using a substitute, stash it in the fridge until you’re ready to pour. This allows for “little shelves” of cold butter, as Claire calls them, to become lodged in the flour mixture so those coveted layers can materialize as the biscuits bake.The final step is a form of low-key lamination wherein the biscuit dough is cut into four squares, stacked, and then rolled again on a lightly floured surface to achieve even more flaky layers. While you could certainly use a biscuit cutter or plain round cookie cutter to form the biscuits, Claire suggests cutting the slab into neat squares (almost like scones) to minimize scraps.These tender biscuits taste great with a swipe of salted butter and jam, a slathering of honey butter, or a drizzle of Southern tomato gravy (don’t knock it until and all that). But don’t hesitate to stuff them with a poached egg or fried chicken for a full-on sandwich vibe.Looking for biscuits with sausage gravy? We have a recipe for that.",

We all know the virtues of keeping frozen produce on hand, and the fire-roasted corn proves its worth twice here: first in providing sweet summer goodness year-round, second in delivering deep charred flavor with nary a grill in sight. Blending half of the soup brings a velvety smoothness, while leaving some whole kernels lends a bit of texture.

Melting dark brown sugar with a splash of water creates the thick, bittersweet foundation of a braising liquid (loosely inspired by the flavors of Japanese kakuni) that reduces to syrupy perfection while the pork belly becomes shreddably tender and moist. There’s no need for an initial sear on the meat either; that sauce packs more than enough umami flavor. Soy sauce, earthy-sweet sake, and a trio of aromatics—ginger, chile peppers, and garlic—add balance with just the right amount of heat.",

    "title": "Frizzled-Onion Cabbage Salad",
    "description": "If caramelized onions are like a heartfelt ballad, slow and soulful, frizzled onions are the opposite—an electro-pop dance track, fast and bold. Frying onions in hot oil gets them a little crisp around the edges and has them walking the line between sweet and sharp in no time at all. Don’t let the word frying scare you off—it takes as little as one cup of oil to frizzle your way through the thinly sliced onions. Remove the onions from the oil when they’re still a shade or two lighter than you want them. They’ll continue to cook off the heat. These differ from store-bought fried onions in that they aren’t coated in any flour or starch before frying, which makes them light and crispy. A generous fistful makes this otherwise simple cabbage salad dynamic: It’s hot and cold, crisp and soft, sweet and spicy. Assemble the salad just before eating to capture the different textures.",

    "title": "French Onion Tart",
    "description": "With a generous layer of caramelized onions and a tantalizing cheese pull, this tart packs the concentrated depth of French onion soup into every bite. Everyone has a hack for caramelizing onions. Baking soda. A pinch of sugar. A little balsamic. The fact remains: Onions only properly caramelize when most of the water in them has evaporated. Pre-salting the onions and starting them in a covered pot helps draw out their liquid much quicker than any other method. The resulting steam tames the onions into a soft, sweet tangle before a final blast of heat quickly cooks off the liquid. Adding water, ironically, is the secret to even caramelization. Pouring in judicious splashes toward the end of cooking dislodges browning sugars from the bottom of the pot, ensuring beautifully burnished, never burnt onions. Flaky puff pastry is the ideal canvas for showing off your work. A swipe of mustard and a shower of nutty Gruyère amplify those flavors you methodically built in the pan. Cut the tart into small squares for a two-bite appetizer, or serve larger slices alongside a green salad for dinner.",

    "description": "Here, the humble pot roast gets punched up with the familiar flavors of a Dark and Stormy cocktail. Aged rum and ginger beer form the basis of the braise, with a bit of brown sugar and plenty of chopped fresh ginger playing backup. This potent combination reduces as the chuck cooks to tenderness, creating a complex sauce with just enough kick. And what’s a cocktail without a garnish? Mint and cilantro, along with some lime wedges, give this cozy dish a refreshing finishing touch.Pot roast isn’t a specific cut of meat but rather a method of preparation. And it’s a forgiving dish as long as you choose a cut of meat that can stand up to long cooking without drying out. Cheap, tough cuts are what you’re after, the ones that have a lot of connective tissue and little fat. Think chuck roasts, rounds, and briskets. These cuts would be chewy if cooked like a steak but are ideal for gentle braising, which allows all those firm muscles and tissues to slowly become tender. We prefer a chuck roast here, but rounds and briskets can be used to similar result. If unsure, ask your butcher: Tell them you’re making a pot roast and let them guide you.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Carrot Cake",
    "description": "What makes for the best carrot cake recipe may be a hotly contested topic; hopefully, we can all agree that the classic dessert should have moist layers that are warmly (but not overly) spiced. Ideally, those layers should be studded with a few choice ingredients to keep the texture interesting. The one nonnegotiable: carrot cake must be cloaked in a layer of silky cream cheese frosting so thick someone might mistake it for a cheesecake.To achieve our dream carrot cake, we stripped the dessert of all nonessentials. Crushed pineapple? Gone. Coconut? No more. The two add-ins we left in the mixing bowl were golden raisins and toasted walnuts. Plumped with rum, the raisins add juicy, sweet pops of flavor throughout the layer cake. Anti-raisin? Leave them out if you must. However, we found the walnuts to be a key textural component, offsetting the supremely tender crumb (pecans make a worthy substitute).We streamlined the spices, too, but turned up the volume on each for maximum impact. Cinnamon and ground ginger take the lead, while a whisper of nutmeg adds a woodsy, floral balance that beautifully complements the earthy-sweet shredded carrots. When selecting your carrots, opt for medium-size ones (larger carrots can be starchy and bland) and shred them on the small holes of a box grater or with the grating disc of a food processor—large shreds of grated carrot may not soften adequately in the time it takes the layers to bake.",

    "title": "Easy Peanut Noodles",
    "description": "These peanut butter noodles have “a depth of flavor and dimension that belies what a fast, easy, flexible, and mindless (and therefore brilliant) solution it is when time and energy are low,” writes cookbook author Hetty Liu McKinnon.Think of her recipe for peanut noodles as a formula. The highly adaptable peanut butter sauce comprises “a nutty, full-bodied base thinned out with a mix of something acidic to cut through the richness, something sweet for balance, and something salty for a jolt of umami.” Is someone in the house opposed to peanut butter? Use tahini. Out of maple syrup? Use sugar or honey as the sweetener. Rice vinegar runneth dry? Turn to coconut vinegar, ACV, or even lime juice.As for the noodles, almost any Asian variety will work: Try store-bought or homemade ramen noodles, udon noodles, or soba noodles, or swap in rice vermicelli for gluten-free diners. Nothing in the cupboard but a box of spaghetti? That’ll work too; just cook whatever you choose according to its package directions. The veggies are equally flexible. Crunchy cucumbers and green onions are great, but thinly sliced snap peas and carrots would be, too, as would leftover grilled asparagus or zucchini, jarred bell peppers, or raw shredded cabbage.This dish is as good served right away for a weeknight dinner as it is packed up for a take-to-work lunch; store the cooked noodles, peanut butter sauce, and the chopped peanut garnish separately. And have ready chili crisp or sriracha and sesame oil, plus cilantro, toasted sesame seeds, and lime wedges for squeezing so everyone can customize their bowl as soon as they’re ready to eat.Looking for a more substantial peanut noodle dish?

    "description": "For a brighter winter braise, we’ve turned to floral, sweet-tart oranges and zippy, tannic orange wine. The result: falling-off-the-bone tender chicken and a spoon-coating sauce that keeps you going back for bite after bite. The duo offers a just-right balance of acid and sugar and a hit of fermented complexity that mellows out in the sauce while giving it structure.Orange wine, simply put, is made from white grapes that have been fermented with their skins (like red wine). The result is a complex drink with deep flavor. It’s a broad category, and flavors can range drastically from bottle to bottle. For this recipe we recommend something dry to balance out the citrus. Taste before using: If your bottle skews sweet, you can still use it; just omit the sugar from the recipe.",

    "title": "Cucumber Sandwich With Green Chutney",
    "description": "We gave the classic cucumber tea sandwich a kicky upgrade courtesy of a bright, bold cilantro chutney. The puckery green sauce gets a hit of acid from lemon juice, and aromatic, vegetal flavor from jalapeño and garlic. The herbaceous punch it brings to the dainty little sandwiches puts the rich cream cheese spread into balance and adds a bit of flair. Anti cilantro? Swap in parsley, mint, or any combination of delicate fresh herbs you do like.If you’re worried about the chile spice, you can remove the seeds—but if you’re up for a bit of heat, just toss everything for the chutney into a blender and set to purée. You’ll have more than you need for a single sandwich, which gives you two options: make more sandwiches or use the remaining sauce as an accompaniment or component in a dressing or marinade.We call for whipped cream cheese here, which is far easier to swoosh onto a slice of white bread than the standard brick; if you only have the regular stuff on hand, let it come to room temperature to keep the pieces of bread from tearing. We also call for an English cucumber, which is less prone to getting soggy than conventional varieties. We recommend stacking the cucumbers in thin slices for the best textural experience (just don’t forget to season them). Making a lot of sandwiches? Pull out your mandolin to make quick work of uniform, thinly sliced cucumbers.Cut into finger sandwiches for an afternoon tea party or cocktail hour appetizer, or make yourself a light lunch of cucumber sandwiches and other picnic fare. Just make sure you have some extra cream cheese around—you’re gonna want a second sandwich.",

Instant espresso powder lends big flavor while dissolving seamlessly into a blend of Worcestershire sauce, liquor, and vinegar to create a braising liquid that easily tenderizes the tough cut. And after all that liquid reduces and the short ribs have slowly cooked to perfection, you’re left with a sauce that just begs to blanket a bowl of mashed potatoes.Be sure to buy English-style bone-in short ribs for this dish. The cut is optimal for long braising and will stay intact better than crosscut (flanken-style) ribs. We like a bourbon with deep caramel notes and a subtle smoky flavor here, but any will work.",

Here, they’re blended up with yogurt and aromatics to create a mixture inspired by onion-and-yogurt pastes used in Mughal-style cooking. This purée is added to both the base of the curry and the meatball mixture; it thickens and seasons the sauce while keeping the meatballs tender and sweet. Take care to cook out the paste for the curry until drops of fat bead on the surface, which ensures that the final product will taste rich and rounded.This coconut curry sauce is incredibly versatile. Try cooking canned chickpeas, cubes of seared tofu, or browned 1\" pieces of skinless, boneless chicken thighs in it instead of the meatballs. Just make sure to cook the full amount of purée in the pan before adding the coconut milk and water; it will take a minute or two longer.",

    "title": "Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies",
    "description": "Developing a vegan chocolate chip cookie that hits all the marks was no easy feat. We were on a mission to create a crispy-edged and chewy cookie that would be irrefutably delicious. The result is a recipe you’ll turn to over and over—even if you’re not vegan.Here’s how we did it: We swapped traditional butter for a combination of neutral oil (such as avocado or grapeseed) and olive oil to lend subtle floral notes without being overpowering. Baking with oil also results in a cookie that stays soft and moist for several days. Some vegans avoid refined sugars due to the processing technique, so this recipe calls for organic white sugar (sometimes labeled raw cane sugar) and organic dark brown sugar. You can use standard commercial sugars in their place if desired.There is one rather unexpected ingredient—Coca-Cola. That might seem strange, but it’s rooted in culinary merit. The soda gives the cookies a rich caramel-like flavor that deepens the brown sugar notes and adds a welcome complexity. (Coca-Cola is also free of animal products.) While highly encouraged, you can swap it out for water and still end up with a delightful cookie.Per usual, we prefer a chopped bar of chocolate over chips for optimal gooey pools. Use any dark chocolate bar of your choosing, depending on your diet; just note that some brands use dairy products. For those looking to use a vegan chocolate bar, we prefer Scharffen Berger semisweet for its balanced taste.",
    "ingredients": [

Place balls on 3 parchment-lined baking sheets (or 2 if that is all you’ve got), spacing about 2\" apart (you should have about 9 cookies per sheet). Bake 2 sheets of cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until tops of cookies are puffy and cracked, 10–12 minutes. (Cookies will be very soft and appear almost undercooked. Do not be tempted to overbake.) Remove from oven and firmly tap baking sheets on counter once or twice to deflate cookies. Let cookies cool on baking sheets. Repeat with remaining baking sheet of cookies (or use a cool baking sheet lined with a fresh sheet of parchment if needed), baking on either rack.",

    "title": "Pasta al Limone (Lemon Pasta)",
    "description": "Pasta al limone is more than the sum of its parts. The Italian lemon sauce is luscious and amply cheesy but bright thanks to fresh citrus. Like in cacio e pepe and fettuccine Alfredo, the key to this weeknight pasta dinner is not an abundance of ingredients (there are only five) or a long slow simmer (it takes just 15 minutes start to finish). Instead, this classic lemon pasta recipe relies on the power of emulsion—and on your patience.First, you’ll infuse the cream with lemon flavor using the zest, then whisk in cold butter, one tablespoon at a time, until each addition is fully incorporated. You’ll follow suit with the Parmesan cheese: Allow each handful to become one with the creamy lemon pasta sauce before adding the next. Plop in the cheese all at once and you’re likely to end up with a glob that refuses to play nicely with the tangle of spaghetti (or linguine if preferred). A pour of starchy pasta water gives the sauce body, but remember that you’ll add fresh lemon juice (which will loosen the sauce further) to the pot after it comes off the heat. Adding it too soon can cause the sauce to break and curdle, not to mention dull the lemon’s acidity. If you need more guidance, check out this video.Looking for a side dish? This lemony pasta dish pairs well with a big green salad and a loaf of garlic bread or a mix of fresh and pickled vegetables via our Giardiniera Antipasto Platter.",

      "Cook 12 oz. spaghetti or other long pasta in another large pot of boiling heavily salted water according to package directions, stirring occasionally, until very al dente (pasta will finish cooking in the sauce).",

Whisk in 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, 1 Tbsp. at a time, until melted and sauce is creamy and emulsified. Remove from heat.",
      "Just before pasta is al dente, scoop out 1½ cups pasta cooking liquid. Add ¾ cup pasta cooking liquid to cream sauce and return to medium heat. Using tongs, transfer spaghetti to pot with sauce (it’s okay if a little water comes along with it). Cook pasta, tossing often and adding 3 oz. finely grated Parmesan (about ¾ cup) little by little, until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in reserved lemon juice. If sauce looks tight, add 1–2 Tbsp. more pasta cooking liquid (cream sauces tighten up very quickly as they cool, so it’s better to lean on the saucier side of things). Season with more salt, if needed.",

    "title": "Tomato Gravy",
    "description": "The definition of tomato gravy depends on where you seek it. First, let’s be clear: This is not “gravy” as in the tomato sauce Italian American nonnas simmer on their stovetops on Sunday. “Tomato gravy is to different people what they want it to be,” explains Southern chef John Currence in his book Big Bad Breakfast: The Most Important Book of the Day. In Cajun cooking, it’s made with tomatoes, peppers, and a roux, and in Appalachian cuisine, it’s a rich gravy that’s often served at breakfast, spooned over homemade biscuits or grits.This recipe, which Currence developed for a 2011 Thanksgiving spread, is from the Appalachian camp. In some, a roux is made with bacon grease drippings, but this one uses butter (making it a wonderful vegetarian alternative to sausage gravy). Fresh tomatoes shine here when in season; the rest of the year, canned tomatoes work fine. A smidge of cayenne wakes up the flavors and cuts through the richness, but if you’re a heat-seeker, feel free to add more to taste. Remember that stewed tomatoes are high in acid, which can eat away at a cast-iron skillet’s seasoning, so opt for a stainless-steel saucepan when making this.Beyond breakfast and holidays, this sauce is excellent drizzled over meatloaf and mashed potatoes or grilled pork tenderloin and cornbread—or used as a dip for grilled cheese soldiers.",

    "title": "Quick-Pickled Red Onions",
    "description": "This pickled red onion recipe might be simple, but it has layers. The strategy for making them, as noted by one astute reviewer, is pretty much “mix everything together and wait.” One more bonus? It’s made entirely from pantry staples: The pickling liquid is water, salt, sugar, and vinegar. That’s it! We’ve opted for cider vin here, but white wine vinegar, red wine vinegar, sherry vinegar, or rice vinegar would all be fine.Consider this easy recipe a blueprint: Switch out the sweetener for maple syrup or honey; add seasonings such as ½ tsp. crushed black peppercorns, coriander, or red pepper flakes; or toss in a smashed garlic clove, a slice of jalapeño, a few sprigs of thyme or oregano, or a bay leaf. For the prettiest pickles, slice your onions vertically to keep the slivers relatively equal in size.You’ll need at least an hour for this pickled red onion pickle. Need quicker quick-pickles? Heat the brine in a small pot until it simmers around the edges, then pour the warm vinegar mixture over the sliced onions; they should be ready in about 15 minutes. Once cool, you can refrigerate them (in their liquid) for up to two weeks. Because they go with literally everything, they probably won’t be around that long. You can use your red onion pickles to brighten up a juicy pile of ribs or your favorite breakfast sandwich. Scatter them over a grain bowl or fish taco.

Somewhere along the way the flavor began to matter less than the hue. Red velvet was no longer just a cake—it was a lifestyle. It was a cheesecake, an air freshener, a candle to be lit while you luxuriate in the bath. And this is a shame because red velvet wants to be more, to do better, to go beyond just being a vehicle for cream cheese frosting and red dye 40.Here then is our apogee of red velvet cake. It’s red, yes, but subtly so, like the flocked lining of a luxury bag. Most importantly, it tastes perceptibly of chocolate. Nothing like the bitter intensity of fancy dark chocolate, more like the warming milkiness of hot cocoa in a cup. Unsweetened chocolate proves to be a winner: The cocoa butter in the chocolate makes the cake extra fudgy and rich, with just the right amount of squishiness. We like Guittard, Ghirardelli, or Lindt.From the many rounds of developing this recipe, it became clear that bleached all-purpose flour is an absolute imperative. In a cake as soft and tender as this one, with a higher amount of sugar than flour (called a high-ratio cake in professional circles), only bleached flour can absorb and withstand the extra moisture. With unbleached flour, the cake will be dense, bearing a visible band of gumminess toward the bottom.The amount of cream cheese frosting, lightened by a generous pour of heavy cream, is modest, designed to show off the cake. Double up if you prefer a thicker blanket of icing.",

Frozen spinach and canned artichokes—two hard-working ingredients that you should always have around—join forces with penne to live their best cheesy life. And if that isn’t enough, it all comes together in one skillet—no separate pot needed to boil up the pasta—before getting a kiss under the broiler for a burnished finale.

    "title": "BA’s Best Grilled Cheese Sandwich",
    "description": "No matter the hour (or your age), a perfect grilled cheese sandwich is the pinnacle of crave-worthiness. This rendition doesn’t attempt to reinvent the comfort food classic; it just guides you toward the best-ever version of it. But first, a few pointers:Butter goes in the pan not on the bread. To ensure golden (not burned) toastiness, the exterior of the sandwich should be slicked with mayonnaise, which has a higher smoke point and possesses the combined browning power of oil and egg yolks. When mayo-slicked slices of bread meet butter-slicked pan, that’s what makes crispy magic.Next, the cheese must be melty. American is the melting-est cheese there is, but a medium-sharp cheddar works too and brings richer flavor. If you want to go off-script, stick to a young soft or semisoft cheese (such as Swiss, Gruyère, or Havarti). Their high moisture content means they’re especially adept at turning molten. Once the sandwich is in the pan, pressing down with a spatula helps achieve even toasting and encourages bread and cheese to meld. But don’t be overzealous; this is not a smashed cheese sandwich.Lastly, cut the sandwich diagonally—sandwiches cut this way actually taste better. We don’t make the rules.Looking for a riff on the classic grilled cheese recipe? We have those too. There’s one with a kick courtesy of mustard and pickled jalapeños, another inspired by cheesy garlic bread, and many more. Making grilled cheese for a crowd? You’re gonna need a griddle.",

      "1 Tbsp. unsalted butter",
      "2 oz. thinly sliced American cheese or cheddar (about 4 slices)"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Place 2 slices ½\"-thick Pullman or other white bread on a cutting board; spread top of each piece of bread with 1 Tbsp. from 2 Tbsp. mayonnaise (this is key to a golden, delectable crunch).",
      "Warm a small skillet (nonstick, ideally) over medium heat. Add half of 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter. When it melts, place 1 slice of bread, mayonnaise side down, in skillet; top with 2 oz. thinly sliced American cheese or cheddar (about 4 slices); season with freshly ground black pepper. Top with second slice of bread, mayonnaise side up. When underside is golden brown, about 4 minutes, turn sandwich and add remaining butter to skillet. Press down on sandwich to encourage even browning and to help cheese melt—be gentle, don’t smash it. Cook until second side is golden brown and cheese is melted. Eat immediately, preferably with tomato soup. Editor’s note: This easy recipe for grilled cheese sandwiches was first printed in our March 2015 issue as ‘Best-Ever Grilled Cheese.’ Head this way for more of our very best sandwich recipes →"

    "description": "Skinless, boneless chicken breasts: You either love ’em or you don’t. For those in the latter camp, this easy chicken piccata recipe is here to convert you. Served over a pile of pasta or next to a crisp iceberg salad (with crusty bread for mopping up the bright, buttery lemon-caper sauce), few weeknight dinners are so delicious and also so easy.The key to the best chicken piccata is pounding butterflied chicken breasts into even cutlets. If you don’t have a meat mallet, use a small frying pan or rolling pin (on a durable surface!) to gently flatten each halved piece of chicken. For the sauce, use a dry Italian white wine such as Pinot Grigio or Vermentino and have it ready to pour into the pan the minute the garlic turns golden so that nothing burns. Scrape up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan, then swirl in the capers and a few tablespoons of butter to create an emulsion, i.e., turn it into a rich, glossy sauce that clings to the seared cutlets. Garnish with fresh parsley and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.One more thing: After you’ve fallen in love with the lemony chicken piccata sauce (you will, trust us), you’ll be looking for more ways to make and use it. May we recommend skipping the gravy next time you make mashed potatoes? Or draping the silky emulsion over roasted winter vegetables? You’ll be glad you did.",

Where the traditional rolled version is often relegated to special occasions because of its laborious nature, lazy cabbage rolls are quicker and more efficient, with little sacrifice in flavor. The defining feature of lazy-style rolls is that the cabbage leaves are incorporated into the filling, instead of individually rolling them around it. You can switch up the filling by using a 50-50 combination of ground pork and fatty ground beef, or pork and lamb as I often do in homage to my Greek-Ukrainian heritage. The super simple sauce demands a good-quality tomato purée. Look for ones in glass jars or Tetra Paks, sometimes labeled “passata.” The flavor is fresher and better suited to the dish than canned alternatives.",

    "title": "Gluten-Free Focaccia With Rosemary and Onion",
    "description": "The goal: Develop a recipe for gluten-free focaccia that rivals our wildly popular recipe for no-knead focaccia. Getting there was no easy task. Flour is a fairly small component in cakes and cookies relative to the other ingredients. But bread? Bread recipes hinge on gluten, which is formed by the reaction of (usually) wheat-based bread flour or all-purpose flour and water.The open, airy structure of conventional bread results from a strong gluten network trapping carbon dioxide as the dough rises. The trick to reproducing this in gluten-free baking is to create a dough that’s sticky and thick enough to do the same. Our solution? Psyllium husk, a natural fiber so powerfully absorbent that it can turn a thin batter into a workable bread dough. When mixed with liquid, the husks form a sticky, stretchy gel that mimics the elasticity of gluten, creating enough structure to trap gas bubbles as the yeast expands.The result is this actually easy wheat-free focaccia, which bakes up with an open, chewy crumb, a crispy crust awash in olive oil, and trademark dimples filled with fresh rosemary and onion. It’s made to be eaten on its own, a delightful side dish in its own right, or torn off in chunks and dunked into soup. But you can also treat this loaf as Italian sandwich bread: Slice a square through the center and pile it high with cheese, meat, and vegetables. Or use it as a gluten-free pizza crust: Replace the rosemary and onions with oregano, crushed red pepper flakes, and sun-dried tomatoes and finish the baked focaccia with a generous scattering of fresh mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.A few tips for success (especially if it’s your first time making GF bread): Use whole psyllium husk; the powdered version is too absorbent and will throw off your recipe. Cup4Cup is our preferred flour for gluten-free bread recipes; it consistently produced the best gluten-free focaccia, but it does contain milk powder, so it’s not dairy-free. If you’re seeking a loaf that’s vegan as well, swap in your favorite gluten-free flour mix (look for a mix that contains xanthan gum, another ingredient that helps bind things in the absence of gluten) and use a vegan butter substitute to grease the baking pan. Finally, note that you must use instant yeast. Active dry yeast requires warm water to reach its full potential, but warm water would essentially deactivate the baking powder used here as a secondary leavener. Result: gummy bread. Instant yeast, on the other hand, can be mixed with room-temperature water without suffering any performance issues.",

      "Add 2¼ tsp. instant yeast, 1½ tsp. baking powder, and 2 tsp. finely chopped rosemary to mixture and stir vigorously until no large, undissolved lumps remain.

      "Generously grease a 10\"-diameter cast-iron skillet or 9\" square metal pan with room-temperature unsalted butter; pour 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into pan and swirl to coat (this double greasing prevents any sticking and helps create a golden brown bottom crust). Using a rubber spatula, scrape focaccia dough into prepared pan. With oiled hands, pat dough to smooth surface and extend to edges of pan. Cover (a baking sheet is excellent for this) and let dough rise in a warm place until puffy and jiggly, 45–60 minutes, depending on the temperature of the room.",

Shaved fennel (use a mandoline if you have one and reserve the springy green fronds for garnish) and hearty farro make it feel like a full meal. The creamy dressing swoosh on the bottom—here’s where the goat cheese comes in—adds richness and a little tang.Precooked beets, which you can find in the produce department, make this recipe a flash to put together.

    "title": "One-Pot Broccoli Mac and Cheese",
    "description": "Having this broccoli mac and cheese recipe in your back pocket means a comforting weeknight dinner is never far from reach. The fact that you can make the entire dish in a single large pot only makes it more enticing.The trick to making homemade mac and cheese a one-pot affair (with minimal prep time and cook time) comes down to technique. Unlike most other pasta dishes, you’ll want to be really exact about the amount of water and salt you use here. As the pasta water reduces, it forms the base of the sauce, no draining required. Then, instead of bothering with a roux, you’ll toss shredded cheese with cornstarch and add the mixture to the cooked pasta gradually, one handful at a time. The cornstarch binds to the fats in the cheese sauce, preventing it from breaking while allowing it to thicken and mimic the luscious texture of classic macaroni and cheese—without the fuss of whisking milk into toasted all-purpose flour and butter. TL;DR: There’s no need to worry about a lumpy sauce.A combination of Monterey Jack and sharp cheddar cheeses gives the sauce balance: the latter brings a sharp, salty flavor, while the former lends a creamy, perfectly melty texture. And a heap of vegetables (in this case, a wealth of broccoli) only makes it better. To make this comfort food even easier, we call for frozen broccoli florets (not chopped broccoli, which can get mushy). But, if you have some leftover roasted broccoli or another veggie to use up, feel free to stir it in instead.We’re big believers in crunch, so we encourage you to raid your pantry for whatever toppings look good to you: Toast some panko in melted butter or olive oil or crush up some potato chips or cheese crackers. Or serve alongside some Parmesan-crusted garlic bread for swabbing your bowl totally clean.",

    "description": "Go-to ingredients get a makeover in this low-lift dinner. Inspired by Greek lemon potatoes, in this recipe chicken thighs are roasted to a crisp, leaching schmaltz and blessing the potatoes with flavor and shine as they cook. The end result is a rich, sticky meal that needs nothing more than a green salad alongside. Saving the lemon juice for the end guarantees a never-bitter hit of much-needed brightness. To switch things up a little, use crushed dried rosemary in place of the oregano, or quartered Yukon Gold potatoes in place of the fingerlings.",

A great Caesar recipe has swagger: The head of romaine should be cold and crunchy, the dressing creamy and briny, and the croutons craggy and freshly made. Here’s how to get there:Squeamish about raw egg yolks and anchovies? Sorry! Yolks are what give richness to a classic Caesar salad dressing recipe, while umami anchovies are the primary reason it tastes so good—that, and a good garlicky kick. (If you just cannot, substitute mayo for a lazy Caesar, replacing the anchovy with a splash of Worcestershire sauce.)Homemade croutons are a must—but don’t dice any old bread into perfect cubes. Tear a rustic country sourdough or other sturdy loaf into bite-size pieces. The shaggy edges will hold onto the creamy dressing and make the salad more dynamic to eat. Pre-shredded cheese is also a no-go. Pick up a hunk of real Parmesan cheese (Parmigiano Reggiano if you can get your hands on some) and shave it into thin planks with a vegetable peeler.Use your hands to toss the cold romaine lettuce leaves—whole, not chopped—in your largest bowl. Distributing homemade Caesar dressing evenly requires feeling, so leave the tongs aside, give your hands a good wash, and dive right in.",

    "title": "Manicotti",
    "description": "Stuffed manicotti recipes come in two general styles: The first is a red sauce joint classic with large store-bought manicotti pasta tubes, a cheese filling, and sometimes ground beef. The second uses thin homemade crepes (crespelle in Italian) instead of manicotti shells, yielding a more delicate result. This recipe takes the latter route, and according to BA’s own (totally biased) Brad Leone, it’s the best manicotti recipe of all time.Making crespelle may take a bit of getting used to, so don’t be discouraged if the first few tries aren’t perfect—once they’re covered in cheese and sauce, no one will see their flaws. (Watch Brad’s method here.) The spinach filling is easy, but be sure to use whole-milk ricotta cheese—the skim stuff will make the dish watery, and squeeze the frozen spinach to get rid of excess moisture.This recipe is a project, but all the prep time is worth it. If you’re looking for a shortcut, store-bought tomato sauce works fine, but making your own marinara isn’t difficult and can bubble away while you perfect those crepes. The work is easily split up over two days: On the first, make the ricotta mixture and the pasta sauce and refrigerate both. On the second, make the crespelle and assemble. Double the recipe for maximum efficiency, then pop one in the freezer to bake a few weeks later. Garnish the bubbling manicotti with a drizzle of good olive oil and more Parmesan, and round the meal out with a big green salad and crunchy garlic toast.",

    "description": "This lasagna recipe has “rainy Sunday cooking project” written all over it. But, if you’re into meal prep, you can make the cheesy béchamel and the meaty ragù ahead and pop them into the fridge or freezer. You can also assemble a tray of homemade lasagna in advance and freeze it unbaked for at least a month (and probably longer).The secret weapon is the meat sauce. You might ask: Why in the world would we tell you to make meatballs, brown them, and then break them into pieces after simmering for hours in tomato sauce? Sounds crazy, we know. Searing the meat in ball form helps you develop deep color (a.k.a. flavor) while allowing moisture to evaporate in the spaces between the balls. Mashing a bunch of ground meat into the bottom of your pot, however, would trap the steam and ultimately take longer to brown. And why do you need to crush canned whole tomatoes when crushed tomatoes are sitting right there on the grocery store shelf? We like a chunky tomato sauce, and there’s no standard for cans labeled “crushed”—they may be chunky, but they could also be a full-on purée. Better to take matters into your own hands. (Watch more of Chris’s rationalizing here.)If you want to use fresh pasta, go for it. We also tested the recipe with no-boil lasagna noodles, but found they soak up too much sauce, leading to a baked pasta that tastes dry without all that wonderful ooziness. Our ultimate pick is De Cecco lasagna sheets.This is a project recipe, to be sure. If you want to go all out, round it out with garlic bread and a classic Caesar salad. Looking for something a little lighter lift? Try our Italian-sausage-loaded Cottage Cheese Lasagna, which blows versions made with ricotta cheese out of the water.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 lb. ground pork",
      "1 lb. ground beef chuck (20% fat)",

Mix 2 lb. ground pork and 1 lb. ground beef chuck (20% fat) with your hands in a large bowl; season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, then mix again. Form into about 18 large meatballs (they don’t need to be perfect—you’ll be mashing them later).",
      "Warm 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high heat. Working in 2 batches, cook meatballs, turning occasionally and reducing heat if bottom of pot looks in danger of scorching, until browned all over, about 6 minutes per batch. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet as they’re done.",
      "Reduce heat to medium. Add 2 oz. pancetta (Italian bacon) or slab bacon, chopped, to pot and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned and beginning to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add 1 medium onion, finely chopped, 1 celery stalk, finely chopped, 1 medium carrot, peeled, finely chopped, and 6 garlic cloves, sliced, and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, 6–8 minutes. Add 2 Tbsp. tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until paste is darkened in color, about 2 minutes.",
      "Add ¾ cup dry white wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost completely evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add one 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes, crushing with your hands, and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is jammy and reduced by about half, 8–10 minutes. Add 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth and 1 cup whole milk, then return meatballs to pot. Bring to a simmer. Cover pot partially with a lid, transfer to oven, and cook, checking every hour or so to ensure liquid is at a low simmer and adjusting oven temperature as needed, until meatballs are falling-apart tender, 3–4 hours.",
      "Using a potato masher, break meatballs apart and incorporate into liquid (you should have about 8 cups ragù; transfer pot to stovetop and simmer gently to reduce if needed). Taste and season with more salt and black pepper if needed.",

Quickly whisk in 6 cups whole milk, then increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, until béchamel thickens, about 4 minutes. Continue to cook, whisking occasionally and adjusting heat as needed to maintain a gentle simmer, until béchamel is smooth and velvety, 8–10 minutes more. Remove from heat and whisk in 4 oz. Parmesan cheese, coarsely grated (about 1 cup), a pinch of cayenne pepper, and a pinch of ground nutmeg. (You should have about 6 cups béchamel.) Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Transfer to a large bowl and press plastic wrap directly onto surface; let cool slightly.",
      "Preheat oven to 325°. Cook 1¼ lb. dried lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally and separating them so they don’t stick together, until just starting to soften but still snap in half rather than bend when folded; 3 minutes is the magic number. The noodles will be so firm it will just seem all wrong, but this is what separates al dente lasagna layers from gummy ones. Using tongs, transfer noodles to a large bowl of cold water to cool. Drain and lie flat in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet, separated by parchment or wax paper.",
      "Lightly coat a 13x9\" glass or ceramic baking dish with extra-virgin olive oil. Spread 1½ cups ragù in dish. Lay a single layer of noodles over ragù (you will need to cut some noodles in half in order to fill all gaps). Spoon 1¼ cups béchamel over noodles, spreading in an even layer with a small offset spatula. Top béchamel with 1½ cups of meat sauce. Starting with another layer of noodles, repeat process, creating 5 layers of pasta (or 6, depending on how deep your pan is) in total and ending with remaining 1 cup béchamel. Lasagna should come right to the top edge of dish.",
      "Cover with a lightly oiled piece of aluminum foil and set lasagna pan on a rimmed baking sheet (just to catch drips). Bake lasagna until bubbling gently around the edges, about 1 hour. Remove from oven. Increase oven temperature to 425° and carefully place rack in top of oven. Remove foil from lasagna and continue to bake until top is browned and crisp around the edges, 10–15 minutes longer. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.",
      "Do ahead: Béchamel can be made 1 day ahead; keep chilled. Rewarm just enough to loosen before using. Lasagna can be assembled 1 month ahead; let cool, then cover with plastic and freeze.

    "title": "Tuesday Night Meatballs",
    "description": "We stripped a classic homemade meatball recipe down to its beefy core to create an easy recipe fast enough for a post-work dinner. You can use any ground meat you like; we opted for classic beef, but ground pork, ground lamb, ground turkey, or ground chicken (dark meat for the poultry, please) all work well. Roasting the meatballs in the oven instead of frying them on a stovetop reduces the active cook time and makes cleanup simple—just be sure to stick with larger meatballs as the size allows the meat to brown without overcooking.Homemade marinara sauce is welcome and doesn’t have to take long (this one comes together in about 30 minutes), but there’s no shame in good store-bought spaghetti sauce (and it certainly cuts down on prep time). Look for jars without added sugar but with olive oil, like Rao’s, which many BA staffers keep in the pantry. Either way, finishing the dish with fresh basil and Parmesan is smart.Serve these juicy cooked meatballs as a main dish with a good loaf of bread and a big green salad—or grab a hoagie roll and make Italian meatball subs. Craving a big pasta dinner on a leisurely Sunday? Make a full spread with spaghetti, garlic confit toast, and a crunchy deli-inspired iceberg salad.",

    "title": "Moscow Mule",
    "description": "Unlike wintry eggnog or a bracing summer margarita, a classic Moscow mule cocktail isn’t designed for one season. The spicy-cool combination of vodka, ginger beer, and lime is ideal any time of year. Like its cousin the Dark and Stormy, it’s a “buck” (a drink made with alcohol, citrus, and ginger beer or ginger ale). And like many classic cocktails, it comes with a story: In the 1940s, three men (including Jack Morgan of famed Hollywood tavern Cock’n Bull) found themselves with an abundance of ginger beer and Smirnoff vodka, two products that hadn’t yet caught the attention of bargoers in the US. According to Punch, “When placed in its now-classic copper mug, the drink effectively became a marketing device, representing…the first time a specific drink had been used to advertise a spirit.”Good soda, such as Barritt’s or Fever-Tree ginger beer, is a must since it’s the primary flavoring here. There’s no need to buy a fancy machine to produce pebble or crushed ice at home; simply bash up a batch of standard ice cubes in a resealable bag. And about those copper Moscow mule mugs? They certainly add kitsch, but you can also serve this drink in a collins or highball glass. Finally, we keep the garnish simple with just a wedge of lime, but if you like a little kick, drop in a thin slice of candied or fresh ginger.Bar cart running low? This drink is adaptable: Swap in bourbon for the vodka to make it a Kentucky mule, reposado tequila for a Mexican mule, or dry gin, simple syrup, and a sprig of mint for a gin-gin mule.",

    "title": "Saucy Pollo Guisado",
    "description": "Loaded with tomatoes and green olives, pollo guisado (Spanish for chicken stew) is a hearty, fall-off the bone braised chicken dish popular throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, and particularly in Puerto Rico. Almost every version starts with sofrito, a fragrant mixture of bell peppers, onions, garlic, and cilantro or culantro, finely chopped or blended into a paste. This recipe makes extra sofrito, so you can freeze it to jump-start future soups, stews, and more. (Read the essay behind this particular version from writer Jacqueline Woodson.)The other powerhouse in our pollo guisado recipe is adobo seasoning. We like the Loisa brand, a combination of sea salt, garlic powder, turmeric, black pepper, and oregano, but any store-bought mix will work. For the chicken, we use skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs, but you could also use drumsticks. Avoid boneless chicken and white meat (skinless chicken breasts just can’t compare to the depth and richness of dark meat).Often served with white rice or tostones (fried green plantains), pollo guisado tastes even better the next day. Garnish bowls with fresh cilantro and lime wedges.For a beefier version, try carne guisada, a Tex-Mex beef stew with Puerto Rican roots. More of our best chicken recipes, right this way →",

This recipe is inspired by Nana Milena from the Serbian side of my family. She usually makes hers with ham and cheese, but when her grandkids remember to buy her favorite brand of cigarettes, she fries up a pizza variation as edible thanks. Plush and pillowy with the lilting tang of sour cream, this dough is forgiving and easily shaped by hand to flex around a sizable scoop of cheesy insides. Frying doesn’t have to be daunting, as these piroshki prove. A modest half-inch of oil and a pair of tongs turns these puppies into glistening, golden ovals that are faintly crunchy on the outside and soft and puffy within. Your oven could never.

    "description": "With 5 lb. of dried fruit and multiple dosings of dark rum, this aged Jamaican Black Cake is a treat for certified fruitcake fans. Named for its deep, dark color, the cake often features a splash of browning sauce—a burnt sugar syrup commonly used in Caribbean cooking for color and flavor—in the batter. In her version, chef Millie Peartree uses molasses instead. In a departure from other fruitcakes, the Caribbean version features puréed dried fruit rather than whole. Aging the cake for at least 2 weeks is imperative: The moisture is redistributed during the downtime and helps the cake feel rich and squishy rather than pasty. The final result is a cake with the texture of a plump Medjool date, somewhere between dense, silky, and chewy. This traditional Jamaican dessert is a fixture around the holidays, but is so beloved it’s often served at weddings and celebrations all year round.",

    "title": "Miyeokguk (Korean Seaweed Soup)",
    "description": "Miyeokguk, or seaweed soup, holds great significance in Korean culture. New mothers have it after delivering their babies, as it’s heralded for its nutritional value and purported ability to increase breast milk production. It’s also the soup one will enjoy every year on their birthday (and, of course, any other time they’re in the mood for it).Miyeokguk comes together easily, with just a few ingredients. Take care to purchase the correct dried seaweed, as miyeok is different from other varieties, like wakame or hijiki. Miyeok is sold in long lengths that you can break apart with your hands before rehydrating in cold water. The seaweed will expand, so having kitchen shears nearby is a must to cut it into bite-size pieces. Just a bit of beef—chuck, brisket, or even ground—forms the base of miyeokguk, providing a backbone to the otherwise light and briny soup. (In some parts of Korea, you can find miyeokguk made with clams or mussels.) Ready in about 30 minutes, the finished soup should be slightly milky in color, like a good chicken stock.In this recipe, I call for regular soy sauce, but if low-sodium is all you have, prepare to use a bit more. In Korean cooking, there is a product called gukganjang, or soup soy sauce, that is lighter in color and viscosity, but saltier in taste. Gukganjang is what is traditionally used for miyeokguk, and you should give it a try if you have access to an H Mart or other Korean or Asian grocer. And if you have any leftovers, know that miyeokguk freezes well.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 oz. dried miyeok (seaweed)",
      "2 tsp. toasted sesame oil",
      "5 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
      "8 oz. beef stew meat, cut into ½\" pieces",
      "2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more",
      "2 Freshly ground pepper"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Place 1 oz. dried miyeok (seaweed) in a large bowl; pour in cold water to cover. Let sit 15 minutes. Drain in a fine-mesh sieve. Using kitchen shears, cut seaweed into 1\" pieces. (You should have 2½–3 cups.)",
      "Heat 2 tsp. toasted sesame oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Cook 5 garlic cloves, finely chopped, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 8 oz. beef stew meat, cut into ½\" pieces; season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Cook, undisturbed, until beef is golden brown underneath, about 1 minute. Add seaweed and cook, stirring, 1 minute; this is a good time to snip seaweed further, directly in the pot, if desired.",
      "Pour in 9 cups water and bring to a boil, skimming any foam from surface as needed. Reduce heat, partially cover, and simmer soup, stirring occasionally, until seaweed is soft, beef is tender, and broth looks milky, 20–25 minutes.",
      "Stir in 2 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. soy sauce and 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt. Taste soup and season with more soy sauce and/or salt if needed.",
      "Divide soup among bowls and serve with steamed rice."

    "description": "In a world of processed meat substitutes, this vegan meatloaf feels decidedly old-fashioned. Made with hearty, wholesome ingredients like pinto beans and brown rice, it’s proof that simple actually is best. A few clever choices make this faux meatloaf extra appealing: Deeply caramelized mushrooms and onions are rife with umami and sweetness, while brown rice brings nubby texture, subtly evoking ground meat. (White rice doesn’t have quite the same sturdiness as brown, so don’t be tempted to swap it in.) Vacuum-sealed bags of precooked brown rice are widely available and extra convenient. The oats and beans are powerful binders, yielding a loaf that slices beautifully. You can enjoy any leftovers by browning slices in an oiled skillet for crispy slabs that are excellent in sandwiches.",

    "title": "Last Word",
    "description": "Vintage cocktail recipes often come with a good dose of lore and legend. Case in point: the gin-based Last Word, a rather boozy Prohibition-era cocktail that originated at the Detroit Athletic Club with barman Frank Fogarty. In 1951, the drink was immortalized in Bottom’s Up, a classic cocktail book by Ted Saucier. It was mostly forgotten over the years, until Murray Stenson, then bartender at Seattle’s Zig Zag Cafe, revived its popularity in the early aughts.The drink, which had a cult following in the bar world for a time, is part of a category that cocktail expert John deBary refers to as quartets or “shaken drinks with four equal parts, usually citrus plus three intense ingredients that counterintuitively work in harmony.” In the Last Word, those ingredients are equal parts gin, green Chartreuse, maraschino liqueur, and lime juice.  Herbaceous, nutty, and bright, this recipe from New Orleans barman Chris Hannah riffs on the formula a bit, doubling up on the gin for a drier, sleeker version of the cocktail. During Prohibition, it was made with bathtub gin, but we recommend opting for London dry gin or another favorite bottle.Read more about equal-parts cocktails at Epicurious →",

    "description": "This vibrant purple number goes out to all the indecisives who cannot decide between pasta and soup. The velvety borscht-inspired sauce—made with beets, dill, sour cream, and umami-loaded bouillon paste—is transformed into a full-blown meal thanks to a big tangle of store-bought egg noodles. When roasted in the oven, earthy beets become sweet, tender, and worthy of star-status; packaged precooked beets don’t offer the same intensity of color and flavor. After you’ve plated the psychedelic-looking noodles, don’t hold back: Dollop on some more sour cream, top your bowl with sauerkraut for zing, and add a shower of dill for freshness. Then, as my Polish grandma says, “Eat, darling!”",
    "ingredients": [

    "title": "Double Pepper Diavolo With Shrimp",
    "description": "It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why Italian American red sauce restaurants are almost universally comforting. Maybe it’s the checkered tablecloths and the heaving platters of food. Or, perhaps, the reassuring familiarity of the menu. From penne alla vodka to spaghetti and meatballs, it’s like seeing old friends. Fra diavolo is a stalwart among the classics, adorned with pink claws of lobster or shrimp or a jumble of mixed seafood. Fans will appreciate it for the lick of heat from crushed red pepper flakes, a high point in an otherwise simple tomato sauce. Here, however, the usual canned tomatoes are replaced with jarred roasted red peppers, a subtle but effective change that imparts a smokier, sweeter allure to the dish that plays off the sweetness of the shrimp. Speaking of which, frozen shrimp is infinitely easier to deal with and often fresher than “fresh” shrimp from the store (which is almost always previously frozen anyway). Look for smaller shrimp so every mouthful of pasta contains a bite.",

    "title": "No-Knead Fougasse",
    "description": "Puffy, oil-rich focaccia gets a lot of love from home bakers for good reason. But its leaf-shaped French cousin fougasse (pronounced FOO-gehs-uh) is every bit as delicious, just as easy to bake, and—dare we say it—even more impressive.You can use instant yeast or active-dry in this bread recipe, which means you can bake it no matter which you keep on hand. (When we tested them side by side, the fougasse made with instant yeast showed off a slightly loftier rise.) The fougasse dough comes together in one bowl, and the only equipment you’ll need is a spatula and a bench scraper. However, you will need some time: The dough proofs for about 2 hours and requires some babysitting. Periodically stretching and folding the dough builds up the gluten network, resulting in a chewy, open crumb. You’ll have just enough time between folds to top off your mug of herbal tea and get through a few chapters of that book you’re reading.Similar to homemade pizza dough, this bread dough is meant to be wet; the high hydration results in an airy loaf. Resist the urge to add more flour and instead keep a small bowl filled with water nearby to keep your hands moist enough to handle the dough without sticking. The most important step in baking fougasse is shaping: Use a bowl scraper or a sharp knife to slash the dough, giving it its signature leaf-like pattern. Gently stretch the dough around each cut to ensure it holds its shape in the oven.",

If using active dry yeast, let sit 5 minutes (mixture should foam or at least get creamy; if it doesn’t, your yeast is dead and you should start again with new yeast).",
      "Add 3½ cups (438 g) all-purpose flour and 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt and mix with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough forms. Mix with your hands, squeezing and pulling to ensure no dry bits of flour remain, about 1 minute. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough sit at room temperature 30 minutes.",

Turn out dough onto a baking sheet with a moistened plastic dough scraper, rubber spatula, or your hands and gently press out into an oval, with one end slightly wider than the other. Gently press down on dough to create a uniform height (it will deflate a little), then lightly press ½ (heaping) cup pitted green olives, coarsely chopped, into dough all over. Brush reserved plastic wrap with extra-virgin olive oil; cover dough and let rest 20 minutes.",

      "Using moistened plastic dough scraper, a paring knife, or a pizza wheel, make a vertical slit down the center of the dough, starting and stopping about 1\" from each end, and gently stretch out dough around cut to open (this will ensure that you can see the design after baking). Make about 3 shorter cuts on each side of long cut, working on a slight diagonal (like the veins on a leaf) and gently stretch out dough around each cut.

    "title": "Mustardy Cider-Braised Pork Chops",
    "description": "Braising doesn’t have to mean long cooking times. For tender cuts like pork chops, the secret to a great braise lies in the method, not in hours on the stove. First, a hard sear on the meat, as well as halved shallots and apples, creates a beautiful fond (the delicious caramelized bits left in the bottom of the pan after cooking). Deglazing the pan with a tart-savory combination of hard cider, vinegar, and stock loosens up that layer of browned goodness and reduces down to gravy in about 20 minutes. To finish, the chops simmer in the sauce until they’re cooked through. Voilà: cooked-all-day depth in under an hour.",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 1½\"-thick bone-in rib pork chops (about 2 lb. total)",

Transfer apples to plate with chops.",
      "Reduce heat to medium, add 4 garlic cloves, finely grated, to pan, and cook, stirring constantly, just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add ¼ cup Dijon mustard, 3 Tbsp. all-purpose flour, and 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter; stir to coat shallots. Pour in 2 cups sweet hard apple cider, 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth, and 1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar, scraping up browned bits and flour stuck to bottom of pan and incorporating into liquid. Add 10–12 sprigs thyme, tied together with kitchen twine, and bring mixture to a simmer. Partially cover (use a baking sheet if you don’t have a lid) and simmer until sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, about 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.",

Simmer until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a pork chop registers 145°, 7–10 minutes.

Here, a hot sear produces a glorious collection of complex flavors, and the gentle roast that follows renders the onions fully spoonable, soft like butter on a hot day. If you’re looking for proof that onions can be more than just background players, this is it. Sweet paprika balances the richness of the dish, lending its vibrant red hue and a fruity, mild heat.

Chicken legs and fluffy, schmaltzy rice cook together in a Dutch oven—and the result feels like a warm hug.No need to preheat the oven; this simple one-pot meal comes together entirely on the stovetop. We use chicken legs here, but any bone-in cut (like chicken thighs) will work. Just avoid boneless cuts like skinless, boneless chicken breasts, which won’t produce enough schmaltz to coat the rice.First you’ll sear the chicken until golden brown, then sauté the aromatics and toast the rice in the pan drippings. Add the vinegar and chicken broth, then return the seared chicken to the pot (skin side up) and let it simmer. The chicken legs will cook through gently as the rice steams, imbuing the grains with tons of flavor. Finish this one-pot meal with a few spoonfuls of bright, herbaceous green olive gremolata; keep the rest on the side for everyone to garnish their plates to their liking. This one-pot chicken and rice recipe delivers simple, satisfying comfort food any night of the week.

Whether the spiced lentil-and-rice khichdi I grew up eating, velvety congee, or old-fashioned oatmeal, it’s a dish meant to warm and sustain you. The only sticking point is all that stirring. Patiently drawing out the starches in the grains is crucial to the rib-sticking texture you’re after, but standing over the stove and constantly scraping down the sides of a pot is not always so soothing. So for you, for all of us, here is an oven-baked rice porridge that’s just as luscious as one made on the stovetop and doesn’t require your undivided attention. The creamy rice is infused with the gentle heat of garlic and ginger and the savoriness of mushrooms as it bakes. Once you pull the porridge out of the oven, it’s ready to be customized. Keep it simple with that classic trio of scallions, chili crisp, and soy sauce, or load it up with a few soft-cooked eggs or a tangle of shredded roast chicken and cabbage. Make it your own—I’ve made so many different versions over the years and don’t plan on stopping anytime soon.",

    "description": "Snyder’s hive, assemble! If you too love those tangy, oniony, otherworldly yellow honey mustard pretzels, this roast chicken is for you. The key to nailing the quintessential flavor is S&B hot mustard powder; made in Japan, it’s a base for Chinese hot mustard that needs only a bit of water to rehydrate. Here you combine it with Dijon, onion powder, honey, butter, and olive oil to create a condiment that plays just as nicely with roast chicken as it does french fries and pork cutlets. Of course, to really drive the pretzel point home, this dish is garnished with a showering of buttery pretzel bread crumbs (made from thick pretzel rods, though you could use any pretzel style in a pinch) for a salty, malty finish.Buying the S&B is crucial to this recipe’s success—other mustard powders just can’t compare with the brand’s heat and pungency.

    "title": "Sour-Cream-and-Onion Tortilla Española",
    "description": "Tortilla Española is a classic Spanish tapa made of scrambled eggs and tender potatoes, cooked into a sliceable round omelet. Served warm, room temperature, or straight from the fridge, it’s widely considered to be a national dish of Spain. This version—inspired by a twist popularized by celebrated Spanish chef Ferran Adrià—swaps in crispy potato chips for raw potatoes. That means super-thin layers of potato without having to use a mandoline.Saving your fingers from potential slicing disaster is not the only shortcut. While a traditional tortilla is cooked on both sides (requiring some real finesse to slide a half-raw omelet onto a plate and invert it back into a hot pan), this version bakes in the oven—no flipping required. Any bits of chip that stick out of the eggy mixture stay delightfully crisp, so there’s no need to worry about getting everything flat and even. Rustic is the move, which makes for a more relaxed path to mealtime.Sour cream and onion—that beloved savory pairing—factors into this tortilla in two ways. First, as the ingredients themselves: A scoop of sour cream is whisked into the beaten eggs for richness and tang, while caramelized onions add sweetness and bulk. Second, sour-cream-and-onion-flavored chips offer surprising brightness and depth. Even if you’re not a huge fan of the flavored chips (raises hand), the results are so undeniable when baked into a pan of eggs, you might find yourself keeping a bag around for this recipe alone.",

    ],

      "Meanwhile, whisk 9 large eggs and ½ cup sour cream in a medium bowl until well combined; season with salt. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in 5 oz. sour-cream-and-onion potato chips. Let sit 3 minutes to soften.",

It recalls the nostalgic comfort of jam-filled thumbprint cookies but with a simple reimagining of the shape and a streamlined, less-fussy process. The dough simply gets formed into wide planks and filled with jam before baking and slicing into long, graphic parallelograms. There’s no faster way to churn out a dozen pretty cookies. Stick with thick, concentrated jams, which will hold up better during baking (look for the word “spread” on the label).

    "title": "Herby Salmon and Potato Salad",
    "description": "This easy sheet-pan dinner gives roasted potatoes and salmon the salad treatment by layering each ingredient on top of the last, optimizing cooking time for every element. Baby potatoes (or Yukon Golds that you’ve diced into smallish pieces) form a robust base, followed by marinated artichokes, which turn crispy in the oven. The seasoned fish fillets go on last and only need about 15 minutes to transform into buttery-soft baked salmon.After the pan comes out of the oven, you’ll toss the veg with a few vibrant garnishes: herbs dressed in lemon juice, briny olives, and sweet pickled peppers. Breaking the individual salmon fillets into smaller, irregular pieces makes it easier to serve as a salad, but feel free to leave the fillets whole if you’d rather plate them as fish plus side dish. (Want to make it a bigger meal? Add on one of our favorite green bean recipes and some Parker House rolls.)This sheet-pan salmon and potatoes recipe is well-suited for weeknight cooking (because it’s fast) or a dinner party (it’s easy and elegant). And since it all cooks in one pan, the prep time is minimal, and the cleanup is too. Can other salmon recipes do that? (Yes, yes they can. But try this one first.)",

Each cookie captures the ideal balance of flavor and texture that actual s’mores rarely do, no campfire required.",

    "title": "Jammy Soft-Boiled Eggs",
    "description": "Practically any dish can benefit from this recipe for the perfect soft-boiled egg (or this one for perfect hard-boiled eggs). While many a treatise has been written about the best approach, all it takes is boiling water and about 6½ minutes. That’s our perfect number for foolproof soft-boiled eggs with cooked-through egg whites and jammy yolks—if you prefer eggs with a runny yolk, pull them from the pot of water 30 seconds to 1 minute sooner.A few pointers: Lower cold eggs into already-boiling water. This allows you to track how long they’re exposed to the heat more precisely. Be standing by, slotted spoon in hand, when your kitchen timer goes off and swiftly transfer the eggs from the hot water to an ice bath to immediately cut off their exposure to the heat. The cooking process and timing will work regardless of how many eggs you want to simmer, but if you’re scaling up, use a pot that allows the eggs to cook in a single layer.The soft-boiled eggs will keep in the fridge for about 3 days, so make a big batch to dole out onto bowls of ramen, salads like this one with rye berries and peppery greens, or toast throughout your week.

    "title": "Cheater’s Paella",
    "description": "This paella plays fast and loose with tradition—it has all the flavors of the Spanish original but comes together like Chinese fried rice. Starting with cold cooked rice gives you a head start and results in grains that resist clumping and remain distinct. Plus, you won’t have to hover over the stove anxiously wondering if there’s enough liquid or if your rice is done. In place of a special paella pan, a regular old nonstick or cast-iron skillet does the job beautifully without sacrificing the socarrat, the precious crispy rice at the bottom of the pan. If you can’t find Spanish chorizo, pepperoni makes a worthy substitute.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Matzo Ball Soup",
    "description": "Dubbed “Jewish penicillin” by bubbes and zaydes everywhere, matzo ball soup has devotees. But fans who grew up eating the comfort food favorite tend to have firmly set opinions. Some love “floaters,” or light, fluffy matzo balls; others prefer “sinkers,” a denser style of dumplings. This version meets the two camps in the middle, with matzo balls that are rich and flavorful (thanks to the addition of schmaltz, a.k.a. rendered chicken fat) and tender and light (thanks to a splash of seltzer or club soda). It’ll win you over too, especially if it’s your first time making it.The only leavening here is beaten eggs—mix them thoroughly into the matzo meal batter so the balls plump evenly. The batter needs time to hydrate before you can form the balls; refrigerate it for at least a few hours (up to overnight) until it transforms into a workable dough. We cook the matzo balls in salted, gently boiling water, not chicken broth. This ensures the balls are perfectly seasoned and leaves you with a beautifully clear soup broth. (For more tips, check out this helpful guide.)About that broth: There’s a whole chicken in there. It’s cut into parts so you can easily pull out the breast meat—which cooks faster than the rest of the bird—early on and save it to garnish the finished soup, along with freshly simmered carrots and sprigs of dill. Everything else remains (bones and all) and simmers for hours, enriching the homemade chicken stock with concentrated flavor and body. Take one sip for anything that ails you.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 4–5-lb. chicken, cut into 8 pieces",

    "title": "Giant Chocolate Chip Skillet Cookie",
    "description": "This chocolate chip skillet cookie recipe is a dreamboat. It produces a single giant cookie with crispy golden brown edges, a chewy center, and the perfect balance of gooey dark chocolate chunks and sea salt. It’s also remarkably easy to make. The cookie dough requires little prep time and no special equipment—plus, it comes together in one bowl and can be baked in a cast-iron pan or stainless-steel skillet. In short, there really are no excuses not to make this.A few ingredients make all the difference in a chocolate chip cookie recipe. Obviously, the chocolate is key. You want coarsely chopped pieces that create pools and chunks, which you won’t get from semisweet chocolate chips. Look for chocolate wafers instead, often made from higher-quality chocolate. The vanilla is also vital for a classic cookie flavor: Vanilla paste is best, but good quality pure vanilla extract like Heilala will work nicely(you could even make your own vanilla extract if you’re feeling extra ambitious).Remember, you want to serve a warm cookie, not a blazing hot one that burns someone’s mouth, so let it cool a bit before serving—with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if you please.",

    "description": "Christmas season in the Philippines starts in September. We build and string up festive lanterns called parol, holiday music streams through the streets, and everything is lit up for months. This excess of celebration culminates in one final party on Christmas Eve, or Noche Buena. Buffet tables are set with all sorts of celebratory Filipino foods, but for me, the reason for the season is Filipino-style spaghetti.A mash-up of Filipino and American traditions, this now classic Filipino dish (a popular version is a staple at Filipino fast-food sanctum Jollibee) comprises tangy banana ketchup and tomato sauce, simmered with ground pork, sliced hot dogs, and lots of sliced garlic. Tossed with the requisite spaghetti noodles and topped with grated cheese (Edam or cheddar, please), Filipino spaghetti sauce is sweeter and smokier than the Bolognese-style Italian spaghetti sauce American colonizers brought to the islands.This Southeast Asian comfort food is the perfect addition to a Christmas buffet (or a birthday party, or any other large family gathering). The meat sauce comes together in less than an hour—important when preparing several dishes in one night—and it’s undeniably ma sarap (delicious).If you don’t do pork, swap in ground beef—or make a vegetarian version with your favorite plant-based alternatives.",

Best made a day ahead (in an almost entirely hands-off process), it frees up your time to hang with guests and refill drinks while gently reheating the pot on the stove. “I like to sort the meat and bones on day two when rewarming for extra flavor,” Harlan says. And if time permits, Harlan recommends waiting to shred the meat until just before serving.Texture-wise, expect cabbage and carrots that are “obliterated by cooking,” Lane notes, which contrasts delightfully with just-tender white beans and potatoes and a collagen-rich broth. When serving, Harlan says, “Make sure everyone gets a potato—or slice in half if you have more than eight people.”",

    "title": "Tiramisu Snowball Cookies",
    "description": "The winning flavors of tiramisu—espresso, chocolate, and mascarpone cream—join forces with the textures of another classic, the snowball cookie, to create a sure-to-please holiday dessert that’s both easy to make and heavy on the cocoa powder drama.Make sure the butter and mascarpone are at room temperature (but not melted) before starting; if it seems the dough is a bit too wet or hard to handle, pop the dough in the fridge for a brief chill. The coffee liqueur is optional but strongly recommended in order to get that true tiramisu coffee punch—but if you choose not to use it, add an equal amount of water instead. Rolling the baked cookies twice in powdered sugar, once while still vaguely warm, and once right before serving, helps the sweetness penetrate while also preserving the fun snowball-ness of the cookie. Serve with a cold glass of milk or hot cup of tea or coffee to top it all off.",

    "description": "Crispy on the outside, caramelly and soft within, these turon will disappear in an instant—especially when served hot with vanilla ice cream. Often enjoyed as merienda (an afternoon snack), the classic Filipino dessert consists of banana slices or sweet plantains encased in paper-thin wrappers and fried until golden brown.You’ll find variations throughout the Philippines, with fillings ranging from ripe jackfruit (langka) to ube jam with cheddar cheese. Banana turon (also known as lumpiang saging) are traditionally made with tiny Saba bananas, a variety hard to find Stateside. This version from Lane Harlan, owner of Baltimore’s W.C. Harlan and Bar Clavel, uses plantains. “The bananas we get in the US are too soft and mushy and don’t hold up as well to frying,” she says.Seek out delicate, crepe-like lumpia wrappers at Filipino or East Asian grocers (usually kept in the freezer section) for this turon recipe. If you can’t find them, large Chinese spring roll wrappers will work. When frying, ensure the cooking oil remains at 350° throughout the cooking process, adjusting the heat as necessary. For a party, roll the turon in advance and keep them in the refrigerator (or freezer) until you’re ready to fry.Head this way for more Filipino food favorites →",

Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and onion powder deepen the savory notes, while a little port imparts that nostalgic Hickory Farms flavor. After combining everything in a food processor, the mixture will be loose due to the port, and will need some time to chill until it’s firm enough to mold. The recipe calls for 2 hours in the refrigerator, but you can also try the freezer to speed things up. Rolling the ball in toasted sliced almonds will help make it easier to mold with your hands. Freezing the cheese ball until firm—for about 30 minutes—helps keep its shape.There are many ways to modify this recipe to your own palate. Try the Classic Cheese Ball, our simplest cheese ball recipe with cream cheese, cheddar, butter, and seasonings.

Come wintertime, when tomatoes are anything but sweet, the salad, like all of us, goes into hibernation. But it doesn’t need to be that way! Floral sweet oranges can take the place of out-of-season tomatoes, delivering a salad that is anything but sleepy. Jammy balsamic vinegar and a touch of Dijon mustard round out the dressing, while toasted pumpernickel bread, sliced raw shallots, and chicories add a nutty, bitter, and refreshing bite to offset the sweetness of the citrus. Garnish it all with a few dramatic shavings of Parmesan and suddenly winter is panzanella season.",

A whole category of South Asian confections, Halwas are usually made with sugar, spices, ghee, nuts, and, sometimes carrots—as is the case for gajar ka halwa, the sweet pudding that inspired this cookie.The key is to control the carrots’ moisture by cooking them alongside sliced almonds in brown butter before they get folded into the dough. Chilling the dough before forming allows the flavors to amplify post-bake and gives the cookies their ideal texture; if you’re short on time, even a quick 30-minute stint in the fridge will help.

The cheese ball was a popular appetizer in the 1950s and ’60s but has actually been around since the early 1800s when the first recorded cheese ball was created in Massachusetts.Making a cheese ball could not be easier. At the very least it requires a combination of firm and soft cheeses, seasoning and spices, and something to coat and garnish it with after it has been formed for an attractive presentation. All the ingredients come together in a food processor in minutes. Transferring the cheese mixture to a small bowl lined with plastic wrap will aid you in the cooling and shaping process. Some chilling time is required for the cheese to become firm enough to mold into a ball. Use the plastic wrap to help you mold it without creating a big mess. Dip the ball in toasted nuts for texture and a beautiful exterior, then chill it a second time until you’re ready to serve with your favorite crackers.There are many ways to modify this classic recipe to your own palate. Try the Port Wine Cheese Ball with blue cheese and a splash of ruby port (reminiscent of the one of Hickory Farms fame).

    "title": "Baklava Cookies",
    "description": "The joy of baklava is that no two versions are alike, each a combination of flaky rich pastry and sweetened nut-based filling but with infinite variations of spices that strike a different balance of flavors. This cookie combines a snickerdoodle-like exterior with a hidden filling of honey-sweetened, gently spiced pistachios for the ideal riff.While the orange blossom water in the paste is optional, it really reinforces the essence of baklava’s subtle floral sweetness. Freezing the filling helps the shaping process, as it prevents the mixture from melting or getting too soft. Turning your cookie trays halfway through baking encourages the most even baking and browning. Once out of the oven, hitting the tray on the stove or countertop will give the cookies a flat, crackly appearance.",

    "title": "Easy Chicken Al Pastor",
    "description": "For the very best chicken al pastor, you’ll need to hit the streets in search of slowly spinning barrels of chile-rubbed, pineapple-juice-marinated meat. But on a Thursday night when you can’t get to Mexico City or the local taco truck (or build a trompo in your backyard), this streamlined version goes a long way toward recreating the experience of the dish. Fast-cooking chicken thighs and convenient canned chipotles more than satisfyingly approximate the street food classic.The red color of al pastor marinade typically comes from dried guajillo chiles and achiote paste made from ground annatto seeds. Here we rely on convenient canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce for subtle spice and vibrant color. Instead of the typical fresh lime juice or orange juice, this marinade gets a punch of acidity from apple cider vinegar. Blitz all the marinade ingredients in the blender, then plunge skinless, boneless chicken thighs into the bath so they can tenderize and take on tons of flavor. Broiling the marinated chicken and chunks of juicy, fresh pineapple builds smoky undertones. As the meat chars it develops crispy, beautifully blackened bits while staying tender and juicy within.Serve on a platter, garnished with white onion and cilantro. Tuck slices into corn tortillas to make chicken al pastor tacos, or make a double batch to add to quesadillas or burrito bowls through the week.We’ve got plenty more taco recipes, chicken recipes, and other weeknight dinners where this one came from.",

Making two skillet-size latkes rather than a bunch of smaller ones means a faster, smoother road to party time. Plus, their size increases their capacity for retaining both properly crisp lacy edges and fluffy-soft interiors when made ahead. Serve them right away or cook a batch in advance and pop them in the oven to reheat before serving. Set out your favorite toppings—we love fresh herbs, sour cream, and plenty of applesauce—and let your guests slice and garnish their own pieces.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1¼ lb. russet potatoes (2–3 medium), scrubbed",
      "1 large onion, very thinly sliced",

Add 1 large onion, very thinly sliced, and mix well, breaking apart onion rings. Wrap towel tightly around mixture and squeeze over bowl to release as much liquid as you can. Discard liquid; reserve bowl (do not rinse out; you’ll want that bit of potato starch later). Set potato mixture in towel aside.",
      "Whisk 1 large egg, beaten to blend, ¼ cup all-purpose flour, 2½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and ½ tsp. fresh ground pepper in reserved bowl until a thick slurry forms. Add reserved potato mixture to bowl and toss with your hands until slurry is completely mixed into potato mixture. Let sit 15 minutes.",

Reduce heat to medium-low and cook latke until deep golden brown underneath, 6–8 minutes. Using a heatproof rubber spatula, loosen latke so it slides around when pan is shaken. Gently slide latke onto a large plate (browned side should be down). Drizzle any fat in pan over latke.

    "description": "These adorable bite-size Grinch-colored cookies make the case for gifting yourself a cookie press this year. The tool, if you’ve never seen one, is reminiscent of a Play-Doh extruder, with a tube for stuffing with dough and a few different shaped discs for sliding in at the end. Stamping out intricate, identical treats couldn’t be easier. I love using the wreath shape for the holiday season, and dye my dough a verdant hue using ceremonial grade matcha (other styles of matcha will work as well, but may need an assist from a drop or two of food coloring). Matcha’s delicate, grassy flavor plays so nicely with all the butter and vanilla in the dough, making the final cookies taste a bit like a matcha latte. If you don't have a cookie press, no worries. Scroll down for instructions to bake these cookies without; they'll end up looking like a marbled, green and white version of these.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2¼ cups (281 g) all-purpose flour",

      "¾ cup (150 g) granulated sugar",

Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, and ¾ cup (150 g) granulated sugar in a medium bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl, then beat in 3 large egg yolks and 1 tsp. vanilla extract. Add dry ingredients in 2 additions, beating on medium speed after each to incorporate. Scoop half of dough into another medium bowl; set aside. Mix 2½ tsp. matcha into remaining dough, then add green food coloring if needed to reach desired hue (depending on your matcha, you might need a few drops or none at all).",

Stamp cookies out to fill 2 unlined baking sheets, spacing about 1\" apart and refilling press if needed. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until barely golden at the edges, 7–9 minutes.

    "title": "French Toast Casserole",
    "description": "Want an easy brunch dish that’s impressive enough to serve on a holiday? This overnight French toast casserole recipe has entered the chat. Assemble it prior to Christmas morning, Mother’s Day—or any time you expect an early wave of guests. The next day, roll out of bed, brush the top with melted butter, slide it into the oven, and settle down with your coffee.We recommend using challah, brioche, or Pullman over more crusty French bread or sourdough for a tender bread-pudding-like casserole. We like fat slices here (à la actual French toast) instead of bread cubes to differentiate it from that carby, custardy dessert. We also like the pairing of cinnamon with warm, floral cardamom here, but if you don’t have any, a dash of vanilla extract will do just fine.If you’re an early riser, you can prep the casserole the same day you plan to serve it—but it does need at least 2 hours in the fridge, so don’t rush it. The milk mixture needs time to fully hydrate the bread in order to develop sweet, crispy (not dry) edges in the oven, and a puffy, custardy (not soggy) interior.The best way to serve a baked French toast casserole is on a buffet with lots of toppings. We’re partial to tangy crème fraîche and maple syrup, but you could put out a blueberry compote and salty butter pecans, caramelized apples and whipped cream, a batch of poached eggs and chili crisp, or simply dust it with powdered sugar and call it a day. If you’re hosting a large party, add another breakfast casserole to your menu, like a cheesy egg bake with sausage, or go with any of our best breakfast recipes instead.",

    "title": "Mashed Baked Potatoes With Chives",
    "description": "This easy recipe for baked mashed potatoes or mashed baked potatoes (either is acceptable!) delivers the most flavorful mash of all time. That intensity of flavor comes from reducing the water content of the spuds by roasting them (rather than boiling them), as well as combining two types of potatoes (earthy russets and buttery Yukon Golds).The cook time is conveniently completely hands-off and frees up a burner (clutch when preparing Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, when stovetop space is at a premium). The recipe also saves you from having to lug a large pot of boiling water to the drain (and lowers your water footprint to boot).But some rules of more classic mashed potato recipes still apply: Cook the potatoes until they’re fork tender, peel them after roasting for the creamiest potatoes (or leave some of the skins on if you like it more rustic), and be sure your dairy and melted butter are warm before you add them to the potatoes. Chives are the classic garnish, but thinly sliced green onions can also work. This recipe is best eaten the day it’s made, but you can refrigerate any leftovers and warm them up for a snack the next day. Or transform them into enriched Duchess potatoes or a cheesy mashed potato casserole.Like many comfort foods, mashed potatoes aren’t one size fits all. If a crispy golden brown potato chip topping sounds like your vibe, try this one. Or, maybe sour cream and onion mashed potatoes enriched with heavy cream is more your speed? Whatever way you go, learn how to freeze mashed potatoes so you can make them months in advance.",

      "If serving mashed potatoes immediately, stir in all of remaining half-and-half mixture and season generously with salt and pepper. If making ahead of time, stir in all but ½ cup of half-and-half mixture, season with salt and pepper, and smooth potatoes to make a flat, even surface. Pour reserved ½ cup half-and-half mixture over and don’t stir (this is to prevent the potatoes from drying out and forming a film). Cover with plastic. You can do this part up to 3 hours ahead.",

Enter these butter-bathed green beans with mushrooms and frizzled shallots made entirely on the stovetop.Nailing the balance of textures—green beans that still have some bite, well-browned mushrooms, and crispy shallots—comes down to cooking the ingredients separately.

You can also crisp the shallots a day or two in advance, but store them loosely covered at room temperature so they keep their crunch. Save everything else until right before dinner.When you fry the shallots, watch them closely to make sure they brown and frizzle but don’t burn. And resist the urge to salt the mushrooms right after you add them to the pan. Salting halfway through their cook time will yield fully cooked mushrooms with crispy browned edges. Bathing the green beans and mushrooms in butter and topping everything with the crispy shallots brings it all together.Check out our favorite Thanksgiving recipes, including an extremely easy corn casserole, brussels sprouts with gochujang butter, turkey with a tangy honey glaze, and lots more.",

    "title": "Extra-Corny Corn Muffins",
    "description": "Back in 2018, former BA food editor Molly Baz sent a reference photo for her corn muffin recipe to her team, as planned—and to all 2,600 employees at Condé Nast. “The crowds went wild,” Molly explains. We get it. These cornbread muffins are packed with sweet, juicy corn kernels. Per Molly, they’re “so delicious, so corny, so hot and steamy, [and] buttery.” Aside from sending a low-res photo to over 2,000 strangers, what’s not to love? The muffins get a double hit of corn flavor and texture from a mix of stone-ground cornmeal (white or yellow cornmeal is fine) and fresh corn (you can also use frozen corn; don’t thaw it first). Stone-ground cornmeal retains some of its germ and hull, giving it the muffins a more dynamic texture and robust flavor. A little all-purpose flour, leavener, and a fair amount of melted butter keep the crumb tender.Seasoned with lots of black pepper, these corn muffins are a perfect side dish for holidays like Thanksgiving or a summer BBQ. For breakfast, slather them with honey butter (blend 2 sticks room temperature butter with honey to taste). You can make the muffins a day in advance, but you will need a lot of willpower.",

    "title": "Brisket Bourguignon",
    "description": "Brisket is not the move for anyone rushing to get dinner on the table, but if you have 5 hours (of mostly inactive time!) to spare, it’s celebratory, comforting, and feeds a crowd. This recipe pairs the braise-ready cut with the flavors of classic French beef stew for a holiday-worthy dish that’s begging to be served alongside mashed potatoes and pillowy milk bread buns. The brisket becomes deliciously tender yet still sliceable in the oven, while the mix-ins—mushrooms, carrots, frozen pearl onions, and chopped bacon, cooked separately and set aside—retain their shape and texture. It’s a one-pot, mostly hands-off dish you’ll return to for special occasions again and again.Best of all, this is a braise that only improves with time—a make-ahead lover’s dream. Cook the recipe all the way through a day in advance, then store the pot, covered, with the sliced brisket nestled back into the sauce, in the refrigerator overnight. When you’re ready to serve, heat the pot with the lid on over medium heat for about 15 minutes. Nothing could be breezier—or free up more time for you to focus on salads, sides, or dessert.",

    "title": "Hoppin’ John",
    "description": "Rich in history and folklore, Hoppin’ John is an essential part of New Year’s Day celebrations in the American South, particularly in Black communities; it’s believed to bring those who eat it good luck in the year ahead.According to Toni Tipton-Martin’s Jubilee: Recipes from Two Centuries of African American Cooking, the custom of serving Hoppin’ John recipes on New Year’s is rooted in “Freedom’s Eve,” December 31, 1862, “when the enslaved gathered in churches to await the news that the Emancipation Proclamation had set them free.” In the South Carolina Lowcountry and other Southern locales, the celebratory meal often includes a side dish of braised collard greens.There are several theories about the origin of the dish’s name. Chef and activist Millie Peartree explains that some say it “comes from children ‘hoppin’ ’ around the dinner table; another story tells of a man named John who came ‘a-hoppin’ ’ when his wife took the dish from the stove.” Others believe the name stems from a Gullah version of the French “pois à pigeons,” a variety of dried pea.Recipes for Hoppin’ John can vary significantly. Some call for cowpeas (a type of field pea) to be cooked with a ham hock (or smoked turkey) and Carolina Gold rice together in a single pot. Peartree prefers to simmer black-eyed peas on a stovetop, pile the tender peas atop separately cooked rice, and garnish with a shower of sliced green onions.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 Tbsp. vegetable oil (if using ham hock)",
      "1 smoked ham hock or 8 oz. slab bacon, cut into ¼\" pieces",
      "1 small onion, finely chopped",
      "½ green bell pepper, finely chopped",
      "1 celery stalk, finely chopped",

    "title": "Potatoes au Gratin",
    "description": "Potatoes au gratin is that rare side dish that feels equally appropriate at a fancy dinner party and on a Tuesday night at home with the family. That is to say, it’s incredibly easy to make, wonderfully decadent, and everyone loves it—even if no one is quite sure what to call it (potato gratin, au gratin potatoes, scalloped potatoes, that cheesy potato dish...we could go on).Pick up russet or Idaho potatoes for this recipe; their starchy flesh makes them the best potatoes for soaking up the creamy sauce, while their sturdy skins keep the thin slices from falling apart. When simmering the cream, make sure it’s over a gentle heat (if it over-reduces, it will break). Slowly infusing and blending the creamy sauce ensures garlic and fresh thyme flavor the dish from corner to corner.It’s the cheese (and sometimes an addition of breadcrumbs) that differentiates a gratin from scalloped potatoes. The latter comprises spuds simply sliced and baked in cream, while this potato gratin recipe gets a generous topping of nutty Gruyère cheese and a touch of Parmesan.",
    "ingredients": [
      "5 garlic cloves, divided",
      "1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature",
      "2 medium shallots, quartered through root ends",

    "title": "Cornbread Dressing With Sausage and Corn Nuts",
    "description": "This is not your typical Southern cornbread dressing recipe (or cornbread stuffing, if you prefer). Yes, it gets plenty of melted butter, diced onions, and chopped celery. Yes, distinct bites of crispy, toasted, golden brown cornbread dot the top, while below the surface lies an almost-but-not-quite-custardy interior laced with sage-rich breakfast sausage. But we gave the classic Thanksgiving side dish a wake-up call courtesy of hot chiles and—the true star—corn nuts. Pulverized into an earthy, sweet magic dust and bloomed in oil, just like you might warm spices, the crunchy snack seriously pumps up the casserole’s corn flavor.You can absolutely use store-bought cornbread, but homemade cornbread (like our Buttermilk Cornbread recipe, developed specifically for stuffing) will give you more control over the sweetness and texture. If you’re looking for a gluten-free dressing, use a cornbread made with 100% cornmeal, no wheat flour. Meanwhile, you can leave out the sausage if you prefer a vegetarian stuffing.This dressing recipe soaks up quite a lot of stock (homemade or store-bought turkey or chicken stock are both fine), but it may take a few minutes. If the liquid pools when you pour it in, walk away and give it a few minutes to do its thing while you prep the rest of Thanksgiving dinner.",

    "title": "Shaved Fennel Salad With Croutons and Walnuts",
    "description": "This shaved fennel salad recipe is substantial, vegetarian, and an antidote to every sad side salad that ever was. Instead of meh greens, it’s got thinly sliced fennel that bends and twists but keeps its refreshing crunch. It sports nuggets of deeply toasted croutons, meaty walnuts (or pecans), and shards of Parmesan cheese that balance fresh fennel’s soft anise and licorice flavors. And just in case you were worried about palate fatigue, it gets a double dose of acidity and zing—courtesy of fresh lemon juice and a vinaigrette amped up with fresh garlic, red pepper flakes, and bright lemon zest.Like many winter salads, some prep is required, but it can all be done while you’re roasting a chicken. If you don’t have a mandoline, you’ll want to use a sharp knife to cut the raw fennel as close to paper-thin slices as possible (do not try this with a vegetable peeler). Don’t throw away the fennel fronds; a few sprinkled on top make an excellent garnish.Love fennel? Try a roasted fennel gratin with crispy bread crumbs, a shaved fennel salad with red onions on an open-face steak sandwich, or pair it with pork tenderloin dressed in a sweet-and-sour sauce, inspired by Italian agrodolce.",

    "title": "Golden Chicken With Mustard and Shallots",
    "description": "Yes, chicken breasts can be juicy and delightful. The key here is to coat them in a dusting of flour, salt, and turmeric, which yields a lightly seasoned crust and prevents them from sticking to the pan. Searing the chicken to start yields a crackly-golden exterior on the meat, and lots of flavorful browned bits too. The sauce comes together in the same skillet, with shallots and garlic infusing the olive oil before Dijon mustard, heavy cream, and fresh thyme team up for a sunny, fragrant sauce. For maximum juiciness, the chicken gently finishes cooking in the oven, until it reaches succulent, tender perfection. Rely on an instant-read thermometer if you’re feeling unsure of its doneness, and make sure to let it rest before slicing. ",

    "title": "Melted Fennel Pasta",
    "description": "This recipe celebrates all that fennel has to offer in a weeknight pasta that comes together in less than an hour. Thinly sliced fennel is slowly cooked down with onion and garlic, yielding a caramelized, jammy mixture. Anchovies and Parmesan bring savory balance, while lemon zest and juice contribute brightness. Garnishing with the fronds lends fresh fennel flavor to every bite.There are plenty of ways to customize this dish to your own palate. Don’t like anchovies? No worries—skip them. Want to take it to a meaty place? Cook Italian sausage in the skillet, set it aside, and cook the fennel in the sausage fat. Prefer a little more sweetness? Deglaze the skillet with white wine. And for even more fennel flavor, cook the stalks along with the pasta; just pluck them out before draining.",

    "title": "Fresh Pasta Dough",
    "description": "This recipe for fresh homemade pasta dough is designed to be flexible. Instead of the extra egg yolks many recipes call for, it uses oil, giving it a bendy texture ideal for ravioli and agnolotti. But it’s wonderful for fettuccine, lasagna, and pappardelle too. Learning how to make pasta dough for the first time? The process is simpler than you might think, but it takes practice. Equipment is key: A stand mixer does most of the kneading in this fresh pasta recipe, and while you can use a rolling pin, a pasta maker with a hand crank or KitchenAid pasta roller attachment makes life easier. Let your dough rest at room temperature so the glutens can relax—skip this step, and the dough will spring back each time you roll it. Pass the dough through your pasta maker several times for a smooth, even dough that doesn’t crack. When ready, you should be able to see the shadow of your hand through the dough. Once you’ve cut the pasta into your desired shapes (note that fresh pasta swells quite a bit while cooking), dust it with a little bit of flour or cornmeal to prevent sticking.The same rules for cooking store-bought spaghetti apply to fresh pasta making: Cook it in a large pot of boiling salted water, but start checking if it’s cooked through after just a minute or two. Looking for a pasta dough recipe without eggs? Try one with semolina flour and boiling water. Pair your fresh homemade pasta with our favorite pasta sauce recipes, like white pesto with ricotta and Parmesan cheese, a spinach pasta with preserved lemon, and more.",
    "ingredients": [
      "3 large eggs, beaten to blend",
      "2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour",
      "1 Tbsp. olive oil",
      "1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. plus ⅛ tsp. Morton kosher salt"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Mix 3 large eggs, beaten to blend, 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour, 1 Tbsp. olive oil, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. + ⅛ tsp. Morton kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer with your hands until a shaggy dough forms. Knead with dough hook on medium-low speed until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Cover bowl with a cloth bowl cover or kitchen towel and let rest at least 30 minutes.",
      "Dust a large rimmed baking sheet with cornmeal or semolina flour. Set pasta machine to widest setting; dust lightly with cornmeal or semolina flour. Divide dough into 4 pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time and keeping remaining dough wrapped in plastic as you work, flatten dough into a narrow rectangle (no wider than mouth of machine); pass through rollers. Fold in ends of dough so they meet in center, then fold dough in half and roll again.",
      "Repeat without folding, adjusting machine one setting thinner after every pass and dusting with cornmeal or semolina flour if sticky, catching pasta sheet with your hand instead of letting it crumple on the work surface (cut sheet of dough in half if it gets too long). Continue until pasta sheet is ¹⁄₁₆\" thick (setting 8 on most machines). (Alternatively, you can roll out sheets lengthwise with a rolling pin until ¹⁄₁₆\" thick.) Transfer dough to prepared baking sheet and roll out remaining dough in the same manner.",
      "Cut pasta as desired.",
      "Do Ahead: Dough can be made 1 day ahead; cover tightly with plastic wrap and chill. Editor’s note: This fresh pasta dough recipe was first printed in September 2016 to accompany Sweet Corn and Ricotta Raviolo, Butternut Squash Agnolotti, and Braised Lamb Shank Ravioli, but it’s easy, texturally resilient, and versatile enough to form into any shape.

    "title": "Arancini (Stuffed Italian Rice Balls)",
    "description": "Can you make arancini out of leftover risotto? Absolutely. But this arancini recipe starts at the very beginning, flavoring the Italian rice balls with Parmesan cheese, lemon zest and juice, and garlic and stuffing them with gobs of mozzarella. It’s a labor of love that will inspire devotion in anyone you serve them to—reason enough to give it a try. (More of a visual learner? Watch Molly Baz make them here.)This deep-fried Sicilian snack is all about textural contrast. You want a crispy-crunchy exterior wrapped around a gooey filling that’s never dry or mushy. To nail that balance, pull your chicken-broth-enriched rice from the stove when it’s al dente. Adding a few tablespoons of heavy cream to the finished risotto offers an additional level of protection. For the exterior, a three-part dredge is key. Designate one hand as your wet hand for dipping into the egg and the other as your dry one for the breadcrumbs and flour. When you fry the risotto balls, let them sizzle in the hot oil until they are truly golden brown. For dipping, try Molly’s bright and spicy Calabrian chile sauce. For those who don’t like heat, marinara sauce is a good alternative. Or if you’d like to turn the appetizer into a meal, serve the arancini oven a meaty pork ragù.",

    "title": "Shrimp Scampi",
    "description": "This shrimp scampi recipe makes for an ideal weeknight dinner: It comes together quickly with just a handful of ingredients, many of which you may already have in the house. The key, perhaps unsurprisingly, is good shrimp. Unless you have access to a fishmonger, frozen wild-caught or frozen sustainably farmed shrimp are likely to be fresher than the frozen-then-thawed shrimp sitting on ice at your local supermarket.We urge you: Don’t skip the marinade step—it really amps up the flavor and sets this buttery garlic shrimp recipe apart. Use the time to make a big green salad or enjoy a glass of wine that you can also use in the recipe (we like a Pinot Grigio, Fiano, or another crisp, dry Italian wine here). Before you add the shrimp to the pan, be sure everything else for your meal is set up. The dish cooks in less than 10 minutes and shrimp can easily overcook and turn rubbery. (Watch Carla make it here.) Serve your shrimp scampi with bread for dipping so none of the lemony garlic-butter sauce goes to waste. Plates are optional.If you’re looking for a scampi recipe that sees the crustaceans tossed with cooked pasta, this one keeps it classic but adds fettuccine (linguine works too) and a toasted panko topping for crunch, while this one uses spaghetti and an extra punch of heat from fresh jalapeño and canned roasted green chiles.",

    "title": "Tamale Pie",
    "description": "This easy tamale pie is decidedly not a pie (it has that—and only that—in common with Boston cream pie). Nor is it remotely close to authentic Mexican tamales. Largely attributed to Southwestern or Tex-Mex cooking, tamale pie is a rebellious mash-up of chili (on the bottom) and cornbread (on top). The more literal among us may make the cornbread with masa harina or even go so far as topping the chili with canned tamales, but in the end, simple is best: Create a quick-cooking chili crowned with tender, golden-brown cornbread. If this is your first rodeo with this classic comfort food, you might be surprised how quickly the recipe becomes a weeknight family favorite. The addition of a $2 can of beans allows you to use 50% less ground meat in the chili (we call for ground beef but ground pork or dark-meat ground turkey works too), keeping the dish economical without compromising flavor. Using chicken bouillon paste rather than boxed broth is another budget-friendly trick; it is dense and concentrated and can reconstitute to whatever strength you like. Conjuring the topping from scratch is not much more difficult than using a boxed cornbread mix, and it relies on pantry staples. We do recommend shredding your own cheese here; pre-shredded cheese has additives that prevent clumping, making its texture less than ideal for baking.If you don’t have an oven-safe skillet, make the chili on the stovetop and then transfer to a 13x9\" baking dish and dollop on the cornbread topping before sliding it into the oven. All told, this is a cheap, cozy, cheerful dinner that’s terrific when the weather turns cold.",

    "title": "Coquito",
    "description": "Coquito, which translates to “little coconut,” is a traditional Puerto Rican holiday drink that kicks off the season of festivities. “As the densest population of Puerto Rican people living outside of the island, Nuyoricans have preserved the custom of gifting coquito to lovers and friends around Christmas time,” says test kitchen coordinator Inés Anguiano. The first time she tried Coquito was in Bushwick; a friend’s cousin poured Inés a glass from a frosty, repurposed Hennessy bottle. And now, it wouldn’t be the holiday season without it.This traditional coquito recipe combines creamy milks (a can of evaporated milk, coconut milk, sweetened condensed milk, and cream of coconut) and warm spices, with a generous glug of punchy rum. Inés calls for white rum here—ideally Puerto Rican rum, like Bacardí or Don Q—but you can swap in dark rum for more syrupy, spiced notes (just avoid coconut rum, which has a more artificial coconut flavor). If you have time, soak a few cinnamon sticks in the bottle of rum for a few days to infuse it with woodsy spice. Since this coquito recipe requires some chill time, you can blend it well in advance—store it in a pitcher or funnel into an empty liquor bottle for less prep time day-of.Though it’s sometimes dubbed Puerto Rico’s eggnog, many recipes for coquito—including this one—omit the raw eggs. That means it lasts for a while in the fridge, so you can sip on this creamy coconut drink well into the New Year. Whether you’re serving the drink in cocktail glasses or mason jars, garnish the rim with shredded coconut for the full Puerto Rican coquito experience.More Christmas cocktails, right this way →",

    "title": "New Year’s Day Black-Eyed Peas",
    "description": "Looking for the best black-eyed pea recipe? One that will finally, assuredly bring you good luck in the new year? No guarantees, but maybe this is this one. “It’s a superstitious thing,” says Julia Sullivan, owner of Henrietta Red in Nashville. Making a large pot of Southern black-eyed peas on New Year’s Day is “something my mom has always done,” she says, noting that the side dish, often served alongside collard greens and cornbread, is said to bring fortune to anyone who eats it.The dish is distinct from hoppin’ John, another New Year’s staple served across the South, particularly popular in Black Americans’ soul food cooking traditions. The later dish comprises field peas cooked with rice (or spooned over rice, depending on whom you ask), flavored with a ham hock or smoked turkey.Sullivan’s black-eyed peas recipe is streamlined, requiring just bacon, diced onions, garlic, and thyme. Because the ingredient list is short, using dried peas is essential to developing a flavorful broth; no vegetable broth or chicken stock necessary. As with any legume, it’s advisable to soak your peas overnight (to cut down on their cooking time). Drain them the next day and bring them to a boil in cold water, then reduce the heat so the water barely simmers: dried black-eyed peas can overcook, and a rolling boil could cause them to break apart. Taste the peas often to check their doneness: They should be creamy but retain their shape.Depending on how you spend December 31, New Year’s Day isn’t always an optimal time to cook. Thankfully, you can make this recipe up to 3 days ahead. Store the cooked black-eyed peas in their broth, in an airtight container, and reheat just before serving with hot sauce or pepper sauce.Can’t wait that long to get lucky?

    "title": "Tres Leches Cake",
    "description": "Tres leches cake sits somewhere at the intersection of custard and cake, its luscious texture able to please lovers of both. In Spanish the dessert’s name means “three milks,” referring to the combination of condensed milk, evaporated milk, and heavy whipping cream poured over the cake after it comes out of the oven. Several Latin American communities, including those from Mexico and Nicaragua, claim the dessert as their own, but its origin story is murky at best. The roots of milk cake can be traced back to medieval England, when cooks would often soak stale cake to make trifle, extending its shelf life.In this version from Alma, a now-closed Dallas area Mexican restaurant, an otherwise classic tres leches cake recipe includes a fourth leche—whole milk—beaten into the sponge cake batter for good measure. The cake will absorb most of the rum-laced soak if you give it time, but if there’s any remaining sauce, spoon it over the top before you serve it.This tres leches cake is delicious as is, but if you want to decorate it for a party, you could frost the top of the cake with sweetened whipped cream or gild it with sliced strawberries, mangoes, or kiwis.",

    "title": "Turkey Gravy",
    "description": "The best turkey gravy starts with Make-Ahead Turkey Stock, which relies on readily available (and relatively inexpensive) turkey wings. Make a batch now for all your Thanksgiving needs (stuffing, braised green beans, etc.) and stash it in the freezer for up to 3 months. That said, you can make a perfectly delicious gravy using store-bought low-sodium turkey or chicken broth. Choose your path and proceed at will.With a high-quality stock in hand, this classic turkey gravy recipe is a foolproof path to Thanksgiving dinner’s ultimate condiment. It’s incredibly easy to make while the turkey rests just as the procession of side dishes from kitchen to holiday table begins.If it’s your first time hosting Thanksgiving and you’re shaky on how to make gravy, the process is simple: Melt butter, whisk in flour until toasty, then add hot stock and the drippings from your roast turkey. The trick is slowly introducing liquid to the roux; too fast, and you risk lumps. Add the stock little by little until the roux thins to a liquid state, then combine the two elements in their entirety and simmer on the stovetop until the gravy reaches your desired consistency. Note that gravy thickens as it cools. The general rule is to take it off the heat when it’s still slightly runny; that way it’s the ideal texture when it’s time to douse your mashed potatoes. Fill your gravy boat with boiling water before you start (then tip it out and quickly dry) and the sauce should stay warm through the end of dinner. To reheat for any stragglers, have a little extra stock on standby. Warm the gravy on low heat, whisking periodically and adding more stock if needed to loosen.Need a gravy you can make in advance?

    "title": "Simple-Is-Best Stuffing",
    "description": "A decade after Victoria Granoff introduced this classic stuffing recipe, it remains a staff and fan favorite. Cooking an entire Thanksgiving dinner is time-intensive enough, so this rather traditional stuffing gets right to the point, maximizing flavor and texture. As former BA test kitchen director Carla Lalli Music says, it’s “everything you want about stuffing—straight down the middle.” (Catch her making it here.)You’ve noticed we’re referring to this recipe as Thanksgiving stuffing. But since it’s cooked outside the bird in a casserole dish—not inside the cavity of a turkey—it is technically more of a dressing. This method is key to achieving the crispy, golden brown crust and buttery, custardy center the Thanksgiving side dish is known for. (It also allows you to cook your turkey as you wish, without fear of the bread stuffing soaking in turkey juices that never reach a safe temperature.)The recipe eschews tidy little dried bread cubes in favor of ragged chunks of torn crusty white bread. Those irregular crags make for a more interesting texture than uniform squares and give the finished stuffing an appealing rustic look. Italian or French bread, like a pane Pugliese, boule, or miche, work well. You could also choose sourdough bread such as pain de champagne. Just avoid packaged sandwich bread, which isn’t sturdy enough to stand up to the stuffing treatment. We recommend making chicken stock (or turkey stock) ahead of time, if possible; if you’re short on time, store-bought chicken broth is fine (go low-sodium to keep the salt in check). But we won’t concede on the fresh herbs: Fresh parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (sing it with us) make this classic stuffing stand out more than their dried counterparts ever could—and they’re helpful to have on hand for other holiday classics.If you want to mix it up with other kinds of bread (we see you, brioche and cornbread!) or without any bread at all, we’ve got plenty more homemade stuffing recipes to choose from.",

The cake’s instant popularity among BA staff is enough to tell me it will be a winner wherever this recipe finds you.For thorough mashing (particularly if your bananas aren’t entirely ripe yet), place the fruit in a zip-top bag and mash with your hands to create a pulpy, baby-food-like consistency. Some small lumps are okay, but a smoother mash begets a fluffier cake.

    "title": "Ultra-Creamy Mashed Potatoes",
    "description": "We hate to pick sides, but if you forced us to choose our absolute best mashed potatoes recipe, this one would top the list of contenders. It produces a supremely fluffy mash and might just be the creamiest side dish around.Yukon Golds are hands down the best potatoes for mashing; they have a rich buttery flavor and creamy mouthfeel before introducing them to any dairy. (But yes, you can use russet potatoes if you must.) It’s important to cook the potatoes in well-salted water; anything less and the spuds will never taste fully seasoned. Boiling them with their skins on keeps them from taking on too much moisture too soon, allowing for a higher ratio of milk and cream later on. (Read more in our guide to boiling potatoes.)For the perfect mashed potatoes, a ricer or food mill is a necessity. For one thing, they’ll catch all those skins, and secondly, they have the ability to process the potatoes to a fine purée without turning them gummy or gluey. (A potato masher could never; for more pro tips, watch Andy make them here.)If you’re tight on time on Thanksgiving or any other day you plan to serve this comfort food classic; you can make this recipe a day in advance and tuck it into the refrigerator. And while you’re at it, you could get a head start on this turkey gravy, which you can reheat in the roasting pan (along with any drippings) once the turkey comes out of the oven.On days when your gravy boat is dry, a dollop of sour cream and some thinly sliced green onions or a little extra melted butter gild these mashed potatoes nicely.As we said at the top, there are many ways to go with homemade mashed potatoes. If you want to branch out, consider these roasted-garlic mashed potatoes with miso, an extra-silky mash topped with a crispy, crunchy garnish, mashed baked potatoes finished with half-and-half and chives, or check two recipes off your list by making mashed sweet potatoes instead.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Green Bean Casserole",
    "description": "For many, no Thanksgiving side dish spread is complete without a homemade green bean casserole. According to Campbell’s Soup Company, which is responsible for the original recipe, it’s served at 20 million tables every year. There are nearly as many variations as there are Thanksgiving tablescapes. And sure, you could go with the tried-and-true French’s Green Bean Casserole (with canned soup and canned green beans, it’s certainly the easy choice). But upgrading to a homemade sauce and fresh green beans isn’t that much more difficult—and if you ask us, it tastes worlds better.In 2016 test kitchen director Chris Morocco set out to develop his ideal version of the classic green bean casserole recipe. He swapped out store-bought cream of mushroom soup in favor of fresh sliced criminis and a béchamel finished with Parmesan cheese. Well-browned mushrooms are crucial for building flavor here, so he cooked them in batches, making sure not to season them until they were beautifully caramelized (salting too soon will lead to soggy, steamed mushrooms).Then came the onion topping. You may assume Chris opted for DIY fried shallots (and you certainly could if you’re so inclined), but he threw us a curveball. According to Chris, French’s Crispy Fried Onions are famous for a reason: “They are astonishingly delicious and practically define this Thanksgiving classic,” so we let them stay.While many a casserole dish can be made ahead of time, this green bean casserole is best made day-of, so plan accordingly and use the bake time to work on a few other perfect side dishes, like our Ultra-Creamy Mashed Potatoes, a streamlined cranberry sauce, and a cornflake-topped sweet potato casserole.",

Remove from heat and whisk in 4 garlic cloves, finely grated, and ½ cup grated Parmesan; season with salt and freshly ground pepper.",
      "Arrange green beans and mushrooms in a 2-qt. baking dish. Pour sauce over bean mixture (it may not look like enough, but it will get saucier as it bakes). Cover tightly with foil and bake until sauce is bubbling, 25–30 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until casserole is lightly browned on top and around the edges, 15–20 minutes longer. Top with ¾ cup French’s fried onions and continue to bake just until onions are slightly darker and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes to set before serving.",

    "title": "Pear Snacking Cake With Chocolate and Rosemary",
    "description": "For lovers of a not-too-sweet dessert, this cozy snacking cake is for you. Featuring autumnal pear, woodsy rosemary, and chocolate chunks, it’s the ideal slice for anyone who prefers their cake with a savory angle (like test kitchen director Chris Morocco, who, after tasting it, squirreled away a piece for his breakfast the next day). With each bite, the rosemary-sugar-crusted top gives way to a lighter-than-expected interior. This is achieved by whipping the eggs and sugar until they reach a ribbon-like consistency, which adds lots of air into the finished batter. Leave your snacking cake on the counter to cut into throughout the day. It’s great with a cup of coffee, as an afternoon pick-me-up, or with a spoonful of whipped cream or crème fraîche for dessert.",
    "ingredients": [
      "⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan",
      "1¼ cups (156 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for pan",
      "1 tsp. baking powder",
      "½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "2 large eggs",
      "⅔ cup (133 g) granulated sugar",
      "¼ cup plain whole-milk yogurt",
      "½ tsp. vanilla extract",
      "2 medium pears, peeled, cored, cut into ⅓\" pieces",
      "3 oz. semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped",
      "1 Tbsp. finely chopped rosemary",
      "1 Tbsp. raw sugar"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Preheat oven to 400°. Brush a 9\"-diameter cake pan with extra-virgin olive oil. Line bottom with a parchment paper round and brush round with oil. Lightly dust pan with all-purpose flour, tapping out excess. Whisk 1¼ cups (156 g) all-purpose flour, 1 tsp. baking powder, and ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl to combine; set aside.",
      "Beat 2 large eggs and ⅔ cup (133 g) granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment on medium-high speed until doubled in size, pale in color, and mixture falls back onto itself in a slowly dissolving ribbon, 12–14 minutes. Reduce speed to low and, with motor running, gradually pour in ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil; mix until combined. Add ¼ cup plain whole-milk yogurt and ½ tsp. vanilla extract and mix on low speed just until combined. Sift in reserved dry ingredients and beat on low speed until barely incorporated, about 15 seconds. Set aside ¼ cup from 2 medium pears, peeled, cored, cut into ⅓\" pieces, for topping cake. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in 3 oz. semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped, and remaining pears until evenly distributed and any last streaks of dry ingredients are incorporated.",
      "Scrape batter into prepared pan. Top with reserved pears, then 1 Tbsp. finely chopped rosemary and 1 Tbsp. raw sugar. Bake cake 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350° and continue to bake until golden brown on top and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 35–40 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan.",
      "Turn cake out onto rack and carefully peel away parchment paper; discard. Invert cake onto a plate (it should be right side up now). Serve slices topped with sweetened whipped cream or crème fraîche if desired.",
      "Do Ahead: Cake can be baked 2 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature."

    "title": "Foolproof Lemon Bars",
    "description": "This lemon bar recipe is the result of some serious testing. Making them requires only eight ingredients (including salt) and about an hour of your time (not including chilling). I wanted to create a lemon dessert recipe you could return to, so it’s extremely simple to make. Potlucks, picnics, dinner parties, bake sales, Monday nights—most things are better with a lemon bar in hand, and with this easy recipe, you won’t have to be without one again.My ideal lemon squares are anchored with a buttery shortbread crust that’s just sweet enough. The dry ingredients come together quickly in a food processor; after pulsing in the butter (plus an egg yolk for richness), the mixture will look powdery but should hold together when you squeeze a handful. (If it doesn’t, add cold water 1 tsp. at a time, pulsing between each addition.) This is just the right consistency for pressing into the bottom of a parchment-lined baking dish (I prefer 8x8\" for thicker layers, but 9x9\" works too).For maximum lemon flavor, you’ll rub the lemon zest into the sugar with the tips of your fingers, extracting the lemon oils and allowing them to permeate the filling. But what really sets these lemon bars apart is that the filling doesn’t require precooking, just a gentle whisk. And gentle is the key word here: Whisk too vigorously and you risk creating air pockets inside the curd.You’ll pour the tart lemon filling on top of the still-warm shortbread, then continue baking until the curd is set and the crust is crisp. Set a timer for 5 minutes after pulling the crust from the oven to ensure it doesn’t cool too much—if the shortbread is allowed to reach room temperature, the uncooked lemon curd will slip off the top and pool in the bottom of the dish, turning your lemon bars upside down (sounds bananas until it happens to you!). After pouring in the lemon mixture, tap the baking dish on the counter to pop any lingering bubbles before transferring the lemon bars to the oven.A final dusting of powdered sugar adds a nice touch, but hold off until you’re ready to serve, lest the sugar disappear into the lemony depths.Head this way for more of our best lemon desserts →",
    "ingredients": [
      "1¼ cups plus 3 Tbsp. (179 g) all-purpose flour",
      "¼ cup (28 g) powdered sugar, plus more for dusting",
      "1¼ tsp Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided",
      "7 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces",
      "2 large egg yolks, divided",
      "1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar",
      "2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest",
      "3 large eggs",
      "⅔ cup fresh lemon juice",
      "¼ cup whole milk"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325°. Line an 8x8\" baking pan with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides. Pulse 1¼ cups (156 g) all-purpose flour, ¼ cup (28 g) powdered sugar, and ¾ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a food processor to combine. Add 7 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces, and pulse until mixture is sandy with very small butter pieces. Add 1 large egg yolk and pulse until combined; mixture will be very dry looking and powdery but should hold together when squeezed in your hand.",
      "Transfer mixture to prepared pan and spread into an even layer to fill pan. Using a flat-bottomed measuring cup or glass, pack into a compressed layer (use your fingers to get into the corners). Bake crust until golden, 27–29 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. (Set a timer; you don’t want to go longer. The crust needs to be warm when you add the lemon mixture.)",
      "While the crust is baking, place 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar and 2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest in a medium bowl. Using your fingers, massage zest into sugar until fragrant and lightly tinted yellow, about 1 minute. Add 3 large eggs, remaining 1 large egg yolk, and remaining 3 Tbsp. (23 g) all-purpose flour and gently whisk just until combined. Add ⅔ cup fresh lemon juice, ¼ cup whole milk, and remaining ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt; stir to combine.",
      "As soon as the timer for the crust goes off, pour lemon mixture over (the hot crust will start to cook the filling and prevent the layers from inverting). Gently tap pan on counter to pop any air bubbles on surface and return pan to oven quickly. Bake until lemon mixture is set but still jiggles slightly when gently shaken, 20–25 minutes. Let lemon bar cool, then chill until cold, at least 4 hours.",
      "Using parchment paper overhang, lift lemon bar from pan and place on a cutting board. Cut into 16 squares.",

    "title": "Leftover-Turkey Pot Pie",
    "description": "We hereby declare the best part of Thanksgiving cooking is not the big meal, but the leftovers. Our best turkey pot pie recipe gives those sundry bits a second life as cozy comfort food with minimal effort and maximum payoff.For the super-adaptable savory pie filling, grab your leftover roast turkey (thighs, turkey breast—whatever you have on hand) and mixed vegetables (blanched green beans, roasted sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts—all substitutions are welcome). Leftover gravy makes up the rich, creamy sauce, meaning you won’t need to add turkey broth, chicken broth, or heavy cream here. (If you don’t have any left, here’s a recipe you can make without drippings.) A bit of sautéed fresh onions, carrots, and mushrooms, plus some chopped parsley and frozen peas, wakes things up and gives them a new dimension.When it comes to the pie crust, keep it simple. Skip the bottom crust and pour the veg and turkey mixture straight into a 9\" pie pan. Seal the deal with store-bought pie dough for the top crust (though if you have leftover homemade pie dough, that works too). A simple fork crimp and quick egg wash will dress it up and help with that golden brown glow. If your pie plate is filled to the brim, put it on a baking sheet to catch any drips. Use the cooking time to pour yourself a glass of that wine your uncle brought for the holiday.",

    "title": "Dry-Brined Turkey With Tangy Honey Glaze",
    "description": "This foolproof dry-brine turkey recipe produces a Thanksgiving centerpiece that is excellent in every way other whole turkeys often fall short: It’s full of flavor and juicy as heck (that’s the dry brine). And two: Cooking the turkey on a rimmed baking sheet, not in a deep roasting pan, is great for all-over browning. (Just be extra careful as you remove it from the oven so the drippings don’t slosh over the sides.)You’ll start by administering that turkey brine, a simple mix of kosher salt and brown sugar, at least 12 hours before you plan to cook the turkey. If you can manage it, a full 2 days uncovered in the fridge will make this year’s turkey the best turkey ever (trust us). We swear by the dry-brining process, which ensures a well-seasoned, tender, succulent turkey. The wet brine method, on the other hand, can be messy, waterlogging the bird and creating a logistical nightmare (where do you store it?!). Pay attention to the type and amount of salt you use. We’ve given measurements for Diamond Crystal and Morton kosher (the two most prominent brands in America), but you can check out Epicurious’s salt conversion chart if you’re using something else—or simply measure by weight. Word of warning: Avoid table salt, which has additives that prevent clumping and can cause an unpleasant bitterness.After the turkey goes into the oven, you’ll whip together a quick glaze with vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, honey, and a few aromatics. The recipe calls for fresh rosemary, but if you have another hearty fresh herb, like sage or thyme, on your menu, feel free to use it instead. Brushing with a glaze, rather than basting with the juices, will help ensure every inch of the bird gets an even lacquer. Translation: more crispy skin to go around. This roast turkey recipe demands patience, so plan accordingly. Once the bird hits the optimal internal temperature (’tis the season for a meat thermometer if you don’t own one), it must rest at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour to give the juices time to settle. Don’t cover the turkey in aluminum foil or anything else—doing so will cause all that hard-earned crackling skin to go limp. (We promise the cooked turkey will not go cold.) Use the time to put the finishing touches on your mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce,  green beans, and all the other side dishes for your Thanksgiving dinner (or to consider what you’ll do with all that leftover turkey in the days to come).Want to change up the flavor? Choose a different dry brine recipe like garlic and herb, citrusy peppercorn, or maple and fennel. And if you’re still not convinced that this is the perfect Thanksgiving turkey, try your hand at our garlicky spatchcock turkey, roast your turkey in parts for white and dark meat cooked to their particular optimal doneness, or head outside to make smoked turkey.",
    "ingredients": [
      "½ cup Diamond Crystal or ¼ cup plus 1½ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "1 Tbsp. light brown sugar",

    "steps": [
      "Place ½ cup Diamond Crystal or ¼ cup plus 1½ tsp. Morton kosher salt and 1 Tbsp. light brown sugar in a small bowl and work together with your fingers until incorporated. Place one 12–14-lb. turkey, neck reserved for gravy, giblets discarded, on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet and pat dry with paper towels. (If you don’t have this setup, place your turkey on a V-shape rack set inside a large roasting pan.) Sprinkle salt mixture all over outside of the turkey as well as inside the cavity of the turkey, patting to adhere and nudging some into every crevice. You won’t need all of the dry brine, but it’s good to have extra since some of it will end up on the baking sheet as you season the turkey. Chill bird, uncovered, at least 12 hours and up to 2 days.",

Reduce heat to lowest setting and keep glaze warm.",
      "Reduce oven temperature to 300° and continue to roast turkey, brushing with glaze every 30 minutes and adding more water by ½-cupfuls as needed to maintain some liquid in baking sheet, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast near the neck registers 150° (don’t worry; the temperature will continue to climb while the bird rests), 65–85 minutes longer. Skin should be deep golden brown, shiny, and crisp. Transfer turkey to a cutting board and let rest at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour before carving.",

    "title": "BA’s Best French Toast",
    "description": "Our best French toast recipe lives dangerously close to bread pudding. Thick, sturdy slices of white bread are soaked in custard for no less than 10 minutes on each side. Yes, 10 minutes on each side. Try this with any old sandwich bread, and you’ll be met with a disintegrated mess. But, if you secure a loaf of eggy brioche or challah, or a pillowy Pullman bread, the results of this long, leisurely bath are slices fully enriched with eggs and cream that taste as decadent upon first bite as they do at the last.A few more tips for French toast perfection: Cook the soaked bread in a mixture of butter and neutral oil. This will give the slices slightly crispy, golden brown edges imbued with the rich flavor of the butter while the oil keeps things from getting too dark.We’ve streamlined the custard, but you could take a few liberties. For a dairy-free variation, swap in your favorite dairy substitutes (almond milk and creamer are particularly nice). We also wouldn’t say no to a splash of vanilla extract or bourbon if you like sweet toppings. If you prefer something savory, like a fried egg and chile crisp, skip it. In spring and summer, nothing makes a better topping for French toast than fresh berries. In winter, a citrus salad is a great accompaniment, but we also wouldn’t mind a simple dusting of cinnamon sugar.Entertaining a crowd for brunch or hosting family for the holidays? French toast casserole is the way to go.",

    "title": "Burnt Toast Soup With an Egg on It",
    "description": "There are nights when the whispered possibility of a cold cereal dinner is all too real. This is a soup for such times, when the coffers are dry and so is the bread on the counter. Modeled after Ferran Adria’s version of Spanish sopa de ajo from his book The Family Meal, this soup boasts a silky texture that belies the fact that it is essentially puréed toast. With help from pantry stars like onion, garlic, and olive oil, the soup is refined, elegant, and good enough to serve to your parents and hide the fact that your bank account is overdrawn. Garlic-spiked parsley and sunny fried eggs make for a punchy, stunning finish.Sliced white bread will absorb a lot of oil (you’d have to add more while cooking the onion) and leave the resulting soup a little lacking in body, but it can be used if that’s all you have. My preference is skinny baguettes, the ones that inevitably turn dry not two hours after you bring them home from the store. Their high ratio of golden crust, full of caramelized proteins and sugar, to spongy interior adds even more flavor to the soup. Stay away from dark multigrain or seeded breads, which will slump into unforgiving goop.",

    "title": "Sweet Potato Cake With Salted Cream Cheese Frosting",
    "description": "“During the holiday season, sweet potato is king!” says baker Amanda Mack, owner of Crust by Mack in Baltimore. The humble tuber stars in her deliciously moist sweet potato cake that’s stacked high with layers of rich and lightly salted cream cheese frosting. Simple in design and traditional in flavor, it’s a great addition to a pie-heavy Thanksgiving dessert lineup.To ensure your cake looks its best, it will need two cooling periods. The first comes after baking the three layers. Freezing them for a couple of hours will keep crumbs from getting into the frosting, which can give a cake a messy look. The second cool down comes post frosting: letting the cake set in a refrigerator for a few hours helps everything come together and firm up, so you get that perfect slice.To make sure you have enough time, start your baking earlier in the day. You can also speed things along by making the frosting while the cake layers are in the freezer. If you prefer a less sweet frosting, reduce the powdered sugar to 6 cups (680 g).",

    "title": "Sausage-and-Herb Stuffing",
    "description": "Inspired by our ever-popular (but meat-free) Simple Is Best Stuffing, we crafted our ultimate sausage stuffing recipe for folks who crave a little pork in the Thanksgiving dinner favorite. This savory, custardy version gets its extra-savory oomph from sagy breakfast sausage and a generous amount of fresh garlic.Start with country-style white bread (sourdough or French bread will also work) and tear it into pieces. Craggy edges, as opposed to the squared-off dice you’ll find in most store-bought stuffing mixes, create a textured surface with ideal crispy peaks and chewy valleys. Breakfast-style pork sausage has the right amount of sweetness and seasoning to complement the stuffing, but sweet Italian sausage is a worthy swap; if you avoid pork, a dark meat turkey version will work well. We load this classic sausage stuffing with the requisite fresh herbs (sage, thyme, and parsley), but we’ve also added whole fennel seeds for an extra herbal kick.To cut down on prep time (and cleanup time), you’ll cook the sausage and aromatics in a large pot with plenty of melted butter, then toss the lot with toasted bread cubes in the same pot before transferring it to a casserole dish, no ginormous bowl necessary.This festive side dish will be right at home next to Ultra-Creamy Mashed Potatoes, crisp roasted veggies, jiggly cranberry sauce, and our favorite roast turkey at your next holiday meal.Looking for more Thanksgiving stuffing recipe riffs?

    "title": "Sour Cream and Onion Hasselback Potatoes",
    "description": "Reported to have been created at Stockholm’s Hasselbacken restaurant in 1953, Hasselback potatoes are a perennial holiday favorite. In lieu of a trip to Sweden, we created this pint-size version that trades the usual russet potatoes for baby Yukon Gold potatoes. The mini Hasselbacks are piled over a ranchy, oniony sour cream sauce you’ll want to spoon over everything from your next baked potato to your entire Thanksgiving dinner (gravy, who?).Using young potatoes has many benefits: The spuds have a shorter cooking time and a higher ratio of crunchy scored edges to tender centers. They become teeny potato poppers you could just as easily serve as finger food at a cocktail party or side dish at a holiday dinner. To create their signature shape, use two chopsticks or very thin wooden spoons to stabilize the potatoes, then make thin slices crosswise with a sharp knife. The chopsticks will prevent you from slicing all the way through and ruining the accordion effect. Use your hands to massage olive oil onto the potato, taking care to get inside the potato slices so they crisp as they roast.To keep in theme, we top these mini Hasselback potatoes with a smattering of chives, but a medley of fresh herbs or green onions—or even a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese—is never a bad idea. If you have leftovers, store the potatoes and sauce separately; reheat the potatoes in a 425° oven just until warm.More Thanksgiving potato recipes, including air fryer potato wedges, cheesy potatoes au gratin, Perfect Oven-Roasted Potatoes, and, of course, Ultra-Creamy Mashed Potatoes, right this way →",

    "title": "Chocolate Pecan Pie",
    "description": "This silky, crunchy chocolate pecan pie recipe comes from pastry chef Liana Sinclair, who created the recipe for Supperland in Charlotte, North Carolina—one of our 10 Best New Restaurants of 2022. Sinclair often finds traditional versions of the classic Southern holiday dessert a tad sweet so keeps her rendition in check by lacing the savory and bitter notes of dark chocolate throughout the pie. First, she adds Dutch-style unsweetened cocoa powder to the flaky, buttery pie shell. Next, she layers a handful of semisweet chocolate wafers into the unbaked pie crust before tossing in the pecan halves and pouring a brown-sugar pie filling over the lot. Don’t be tempted to swap in dark chocolate chips, which often contain emulsifiers so they retain their shape; wafers, on the other hand, will melt into deep, rich pools of chocolate that envelop the nuts.Sinclair gilds her baked pie with a Chantilly cream (which is just a fancy word for sweetened whipped cream), except that hers is enriched with melted milk chocolate, mascarpone cheese, and a splash of bourbon. (Yes, this pie has a chocolate crust, chocolate filling, and chocolate whipped cream topping.) Feel free to swap out the spirit for hazelnut liqueur or spiced rum—or, for a booze-free version, use 2 tsp. vanilla extract. If you’re short on time, a scoop of store-bought vanilla ice cream is a good alternative.While Supperland serves individually portioned pies like the one in the photo, we’ve adapted the recipe for a 9\" pie pan. Set the pie plate on a rimmed baking sheet to prevent bubbling drips from scorching on the bottom of your oven. Bonus: This makes moving the pie to and from the oven so much easier.Classic pecan pie?

    "title": "Green Beans With Almond Butter Sauce",
    "description": "Simply steamed or sautéed green beans topped with toasted almonds are a classic Thanksgiving side, but this version takes the nuttiness to the next level. A mash-up of goma-ae (vegetables in a Japanese sesame seed dressing) and amandine (the French method sometimes spelled “almondine”), this green bean recipe has a creamy sauce that clings to the veg like no mere butter sauce ever could. The secret? Almond butter. The result is a speedy side dish that’s even great cold the next day (try it as a topping for a grain salad or a light lunch). It’s so easy, it may even become a regular in your weeknight dinner rotation.To speed up the prep time, we skipped the blanch-and-drain, opting to steam the green beans (you can use the standard string bean variety or the slightly skinner haricots verts) in a large skillet until crisp-tender. If you’re planning to double the recipe, consider cooking the beans in batches to ensure even cooking and prevent mushy bottom beans and crunchy top ones.The sauce is an even easier mix of almond butter, soy sauce, sugar, and vinegar. If you’re up for a little heat, a dash of crushed red pepper flakes or other chili flakes wouldn’t be unwelcome. You can whip together the dressing ahead of time; just make sure to reheat it slightly before tossing it with the warm green beans. If you’re looking for a single green bean side to serve this holiday season, this should be a top contender—you could even scatter some store-bought crispy shallots over the top in lieu of making a hulking green bean casserole, but only if grandma doesn’t mind.Looking for more green bean recipes? These slow-roasted green beans with harissa are wonderfully hands-off, while this smashed green bean salad with lemon juice and sumac is incredibly make-ahead friendly and easy to cart along if you’re heading out for the holiday.",

The full recipe can be made in a single afternoon, but breaking it up over a couple of days is easiest.Consider day one your prep time: Bring the cookie dough together in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Wrap it in plastic and refrigerate it in disks. The next day, grab your rolling pin and cookie cutters—classic gingerbread men or any shape you like. You’ll roll out the dough between two sheets of wax paper (parchment works too) so that you don’t incorporate too much flour. After cutting out the cookies, they’ll need to chill so they hold their shape in the oven. Now comes the part that requires patience: Using a thin metal spatula, carefully transfer each cookie to a cookie sheet—no liner needed. Baking each tray separately in a preheated oven helps the hot air circulate, resulting in evenly baked cookies. While they finish cooling on a wire rack, make your icing. You can keep your decorations simple or break out the sanding sugar, dragées, and sprinkles. The finished cookies will hold in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Need more holiday or Christmas cookie ideas?

    "title": "Buttery Milk Buns",
    "description": "These buns are a hybrid of two holiday-ready favorites: Parker House rolls and milk bread buns. The former, invented about 150 years ago at Boston’s Parker House Hotel, feature a folded-over shape and lots of melted butter. The latter relies on a tangzhong starter to create their characteristic pillowy texture. (Tangzhong is the Chinese method of precooking a small portion of a recipe’s starch and liquid, like flour and milk, to create a thick paste that then gets integrated with the rest of the dough ingredients.) Here you’ll mash up a milk bread dough with the Parker House folding technique, creating a rich, plush bun that’s as great on its own as it is sopping up gravy and mashed potatoes.",
    "ingredients": [
      "⅔ cup plus ¾ cup plus 1 Tbsp. whole milk",
      "3 Tbsp. plus 4 cups (523 g) all-purpose flour",
      "¼ cup (50 g) sugar",
      "1 ¼-oz. envelope instant yeast (about 2¼ tsp.)",
      "2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "3 large eggs",
      "½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into pieces, plus 6 Tbsp. melted, slightly cooled"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Whisk ⅔ cup whole milk and 3 Tbsp. (23 g) all-purpose flour in a small saucepan to combine. Place over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until thickened and pasty, 2–3 minutes. Transfer mixture (this is your tangzhong) to the bowl of a stand mixer and attach dough hook. Add ¼ cup (50 g) sugar, one ¼-oz. envelope instant yeast (about 2¼ tsp.), 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 2 large eggs, ¾ cup whole milk, and remaining 4 cups (500 g) all-purpose flour and mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms, about 1 minute. Add ½ cup (1 stick) room-temperature butter, cut into pieces, a piece at a time, beating to incorporate after each addition before adding more. When all of the butter has been added, increase speed to medium-high and beat until dough is smooth and supple, about 10 minutes.",
      "Transfer dough to a large bowl lightly coated with vegetable oil; turn to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, dry spot until doubled in size, about 2 hours. (Or, place in refrigerator and chill until doubled in size, at least 8 hours and up to 12 hours).",
      "Brush a 13x9\" baking dish well with some of 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled. Punch down dough a couple of times to release air. Portion equally into 24 balls (about 45 g each). Cup your hand over a ball and drag across surface, moving your hand in a circular motion, to create a smooth, tight ball. Turn over so smooth side is facing down. Press out to a 4x2\" rectangle and brush with melted butter. Fold in half and place in prepared baking dish. Repeat with remaining balls, making sure to arrange buns so folded edges are all facing the same direction. Cover with a kitchen towel; let sit until slightly puffed, 45–60 minutes.",
      "Place a rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 350°. Beat remaining 1 large egg and 1 Tbsp. whole milk in a small bowl to combine. Brush over buns, then sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake, rotating front to back halfway through, until golden brown and tops are crisp to the touch, 35–38 minutes."

    "title": "Three-Minute Red Wine Vinaigrette",
    "description": "This red wine vinaigrette recipe takes less time to make than dashing to the supermarket by a long shot. All you need are a few simple ingredients—like extra-virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, and maple syrup—plus a mason jar or airtight container. In minutes, the players will coalesce, ready to turn literally any salad into your favorite salad, whether it’s a simple green salad (romaine, radicchio, endive, spinach—anything works), something more substantial (like a veggie-loaded chopped salad, grain salad, or pasta salad), or even a heap of chopped cucumbers or tomatoes.While a more traditional vinaigrette calls for three parts oil to one part acid, this version tips the ratio to two-to-one for more brightness and contrast. If you are a member of Team Tangy, like me and many of my coworkers, you could even push it one step further: Drop the extra-virgin olive oil from ½ cup to ⅓ cup, and leave everything else the same. While some homemade salad dressing recipes call for additions like minced shallot or fresh herbs, this no-prep approach is just as flavorful. The result is confident in its minimalism.It’s also a trusty template for other types of salad dressings: Instead of smooth Dijon, swap in whole grain mustard for added texture. Replace the maple syrup with granulated sugar or honey. Add a dash of dried oregano, za’atar, an Italian seasoning blend, or other Mediterranean-leaning dried herbs. And, if you’re not in a red wine vinegar mood, the acid is interchangeable, be it white wine vinegar, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, or apple cider vinegar. Whatever you do, do not reduce the salt. That’s the difference between salad feeling like a chore and a revelation.Leftover red wine vinaigrette is a thing that rarely exists, but if you do have a jar you want to use up, deploy it as a marinade for tofu or chicken skewers to imbue them with tangy flavor before taking them out to the grill.",

Maybe you’re thinking, I don’t need a turkey sandwich recipe; I can make one standing in front of the fridge. But you deserve better than some cobbled-together concoction of slippery meat and congealed cranberry sauce, so get ready to level up.This postholiday turkey sandwich is modeled on a tuna melt. Instead of layering slices, the meat is shredded and tossed with mayo and everything good before the mixture is slathered on hearty sandwich bread and griddled. The result boasts punchy alliums and briny pickled peppers and absolutely oozes with molten American cheese. (Pro tip: Get American cheese sliced fresh from the deli counter if you can; otherwise, avoid anything labeled “imitation” or “singles.”) It’s a crispy, delicious sandwich that feels intentional and thought out—almost like you bought too big of a bird for this very reason.Need a turkey recipe?

    "title": "Creamy Pumpkin Pasta",
    "description": "If you’ve got an extra can of pumpkin purée lingering from your holiday feasts, use it to make this easy creamy pumpkin pasta recipe. Sautéed onion and garlic form the aromatic base for the sauce, but smooth pumpkin purée is the real star. It melds with cream and starchy pasta water for a luscious sauce easy enough to make on any weeknight. Ensure you’re using unsweetened pure pumpkin purée—this is no place for pumpkin pie filling. We prefer tubular noodles like rigatoni or penne for this pasta recipe; their nooks and crannies provide plenty of spots for the sauce to cling on.Some might classify this a fall recipe, but we’d argue it knows no seasonal bounds. Relying almost entirely on pantry staples, it’s an easy go-to when you haven’t had time to run to the store. Plus, it’s flexible: We garnish the bowls with lemon zest and Parmesan cheese, but a few fresh sage leaves wouldn’t be out of place. Want to make the creamy pumpkin sauce dairy-free? Skip the Parmesan and swap the heavy cream for one of these substitutes. Try it with gluten-free noodles (these are our favorites), or if you want a protein boost, top the cooked pasta bowls with spicy Italian sausage or crispy chickpeas. Leftovers will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days; reheat over low heat with a splash of reserved pasta water.Try more of our favorite pasta dishes, like butternut squash baked pasta, sweet potato and kimchi mac and cheese, or veggie-loaded kale pesto with whole wheat pasta →",

    "title": "Salted Graham Cracker Crust",
    "description": "With less sugar and more salt than other versions, this buttery homemade graham cracker crust recipe highlights just how good the nutty, malty flavor of graham crackers can be. Baked until toasty, the crust is neutral enough to work with most no-bake pie fillings, from Key lime pie to virtually any cream pie recipe (banana cream pie, chocolate pudding pie, peanut butter pie) to no-bake cheesecake. Plus, it’s significantly tastier than any store-bought crust.A few tips to help achieve a perfect graham cracker crust: Use a food processor to pulverize the crackers into even, fine crumbs, then pulse in the melted butter and remaining ingredients for even distribution. Finely ground graham cracker crumbs will result in a pie crust that slices neatly; while using a rolling pin to crush the crackers would result in irregular pieces that are more likely to crumble when formed and sliced. Second, remember to heat the butter just until it’s melted. We’re fans of brown butter as much as anyone, but if the butter even sizzles or pops here, you’ll have lost too much moisture, and the final pie crust will slump unforgivingly down the sides of the pie plate.Finally, this pie crust recipe was engineered to work with whole graham crackers, which are relatively dry and lower in fat and sugar than most other store-bought cookies. You can riff on the flavors using chocolate graham crackers, cinnamon grahams, or digestive biscuits, or by using brown sugar in place of white. Other cookies like Oreos, gingersnaps, or vanilla wafers will perform differently, sometimes losing shape as the crust bakes, since they have vastly more fat and sugar.Try out this graham cracker crust in our Simply Brilliant Banoffee Pie, or check out more of our best Thanksgiving dessert recipes →",

    "title": "Roasted Delicata Squash With Crispy Onions",

More like zucchini in nature, slender, striped delicata squash has thin, edible skin, so there’s no need to peel it before roasting, though you will need to scoop the seeds out of the squash halves before slicing them into skinny half-moons. For optimal browning, spread the cut squash across 2 baking sheets and avoid using parchment paper; direct contact with the sheet pan helps the squash turn golden and crispy.That alone is a vegetarian side dish that’ll fit any weeknight fall dinner, but to take it over the top, we piled the roasted squash atop a lemony yogurt sauce lightly sweetened with honey (swap in maple syrup if it’s what you’ve got). Store-bought fried onions are crispy right out of the package, but we take things further by tossing them in a garlicky spice mixture and briefly re-toasting them for supreme crunch. Pomegranate seeds and fresh parsley bring color and brightness, but you could play around with dried cranberries, arugula, or crushed toasted hazelnuts for texture. This might be the first time roasted vegetables outshine the holiday turkey.Head this way for more winter squash recipes everyone will love, including steamed kabocha squash, caramelized acorn squash with tahini honey, and Butternut Squash Parmesan →",

    "title": "Make-Ahead Gravy",
    "description": "For folks who really want to get ahead on their Thanksgiving prep, we present this make-ahead gravy, which you can stash in your refrigerator up to 5 days before T-day. (And, frankly, in your freezer for up to 3 months.) Since we don’t assume you have a casual turkey carcass and drippings lying around, this recipe deploys a different poultry that’s available (and relatively inexpensive) year-round: chicken wings.For the most flavorful gravy, you’ll fortify pre-made stock (store-bought or homemade) with the seared wings and a few aromatics. For thickening the gravy, we turn to Wondra flour, a very finely milled variety that is less prone to lumps. (It’s also great for frying and makes pretty great pie crust too.) You can use all-purpose if you wish, just be sure to add the liquid slowly, and whisk well between each addition.When you’re ready to reheat the gravy, have a cup or so of stock on standby. Gravy has a tendency to thicken over time, but a splash more liquid and a vigorous whisk will easily bring it back to silky, mashed-potato-pooling glory.",
    "ingredients": [

Add a small handful of rosemary, thyme, and/or bay leaves and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in 1 cup dry white wine and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of pan. Bring to a boil and cook until wine is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add 6 cups Thanksgiving Stock or low-sodium chicken broth and return to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced by a third, 35–40 minutes.",

    "title": "Vegan Coquito",
    "description": "It was Christmas of 2016 when Noelia and Abe, my dear friends hailing from the vibrant heart of Puerto Rico, gifted me a 64-oz. mason jar of coquito, lovingly adorned with a scarlet bow. Coquito literally translates to “little coconut” in Spanish and is traditionally made from coconut (both the meat and its milk and cream), sweetened condensed milk, a touch of rum, and a symphony of aromatic spices. My upbringing, steeped in the Seventh-day Adventist tradition, never held holidays in the spotlight. For my parents, every day was a celebration, and festive occasions took a back seat. Therefore, to bloom with my own traditions—dietary restrictions included, read more on that here—coquito would undergo a metamorphosis in my hands. A medley of warm spices inspired by my Jamaican heritage, paired with the iconic Wray & Nephew rum, results in this dairy-free rendition that’s velvety and satisfying. My take on this classic drink also uses brewed chai for a blend of woodsy, earthy spices. Coconut milk and cream of coconut contribute a glossy viscosity—you can swap unsweetened coconut cream for the cream of coconut, if you prefer your coquito a little less sweet—while evaporated and sweetened condensed oat milks balance the richness from the coconut and keep the drink silky. ",

    "description": "Before you write off this chewy molasses cookie recipe because you think you don’t like molasses, please listen to writer and former BA staffer Jesse Sparks: these old-fashioned cookies are “so much more complex-tasting than they seem they should be, with punchy hits of cinnamon, a kiss of cardamom, and the zing of ginger, all backed up by just-the-right-amount-of-bitter molasses.” The treacly syrup keeps soft molasses cookies magically supple for days, making them a perfect candidate for cookie swaps and leisurely holiday breaks.The recipe is also one of the simplest holiday cookie recipes, with very little prep time and no mixer required (not even a hand mixer!). You can get nearly all of your work done in the time it takes to preheat your oven. A cookie scoop isn’t necessary but comes in handy for making even-sized dough balls that you’ll roll in sanding sugar for a glittery finish before placing on the cookie sheet and baking (or freezing for later).If you’re new to buying molasses, keep in mind that there are several types, including blackstrap molasses, and sulfured and unsulfured varieties. We prefer unsulfured for baking; sulfured molasses has a smoky backbone (great for barbecue, not so much cookies). Choose mild molasses for a lighter flavor or a robust, dark one for something bolder.",

    "title": "French 75",
    "description": "The French 75 is that rare creature of a cocktail recipe: elegant enough to make it feel as if you’re in Paris on New Year’s Eve, but made with just a few simple ingredients that come together with little more effort than it would take for you to crack open that same old bottle of wine.Simple syrup is the only element of this Champagne cocktail that requires a little work. Classic instructions for the sweetener call for stirring 1 cup of boiling water into 1 cup of sugar, then chilling the solution until cool. Modern bartenders prefer to blend their syrups using cold water to better control the dilution (no evaporating steam). For the home bartender, either will work fine. Brut Champagne is the traditional choice for the bubbles, but any good and very dry sparkling wine like cava or prosecco will work in a pinch.There’s some debate about how to make a French 75; namely, should its ingredients call for gin or cognac? The drink’s name comes from the 75-millimeter field guns used in World War I, says Chris Hannah, head bartender at Arnaud’s French 75 Bar in New Orleans. “The Lafayette Escadrille were an allied fighter pilot outfit made up of American and French military who would drink cognac and Champagne after successful air raids and toast to the French 75 cannon for their safety.” Some cite Harry’s New York Bar in Paris—also in the pro-Cognac camp—for making the drink popular. Today it’s more common to see the cocktail made with dry gin, as in our recipe, but either works well. If you prefer cognac, Pierre Ferrand is a good choice. Serve this classic cocktail in Champagne flutes for the full effect.",

One big batch of warm coconut pudding gets split two ways: mixed with dark chocolate for a deep, intense bottom layer, while the rest is lightened with whipped cream for a duvet-soft top. Coconut milks vary wildly in their fat content. Too little fat and the filling will be runny, too much and it’ll end up grainy. We found the best final texture with Whole Foods 365 and Thai Kitchen brands. The instant pudding mix goes a long way to firming up the filling just enough so it stays in shape over the course of a day. Definitely don’t skip it.

    "title": "Herb-Roasted Lamb Chops",
    "description": "This herby roasted lamb chop recipe is low effort, high reward. With minimal prep time and few dirty dishes, it impresses for a weeknight date or a Saturday dinner party for friends.You may spot a few different types of lamb chops at the grocery store, including those cut from the rib, loin, sirloin, and shoulder. Frenched lamb rib chops, sometimes called lollipops, are the ones that typically spring to mind, but lamb loin chops, which we use here, are meatier and usually more gently priced.Since the method for making these is so simple, each step is key. The marinade adds flavor, so don’t rush it. Use the time to make a side dish like mashed potatoes, Greek-style potatoes with lemon juice, or mini Hasselback potatoes with a sour cream sauce and a big green salad. When you sear the chops, use a heavy skillet (a cast-iron pan is ideal) that’s large enough to fit the chops in a single layer. If you don’t have one, sear them in batches before returning all the chops to the pan to cook through in the oven.Using an instant-read thermometer is the best way to determine if the lamb is cooked to your liking. Remember, the internal temperature will rise about 10° as the chops rest, so pull them just shy of your desired doneness (130° for medium rare). Use the drippings to make a pan sauce with red wine, Dijon mustard, and a little beef stock. Or slather the chops with garlic butter and bring them to the table.",
    "ingredients": [

    "title": "Sweet Potato Pecan Pie",
    "description": "In some parts of the American South, sweet potato pie is the quintessential Thanksgiving dessert. In others, pecan pie is de rigueur. This recipe mashes the two together with a custardy spiced sweet potato filling and glossy pecan topping. (Beat that, pumpkin pie.)The key is to purée the sweet potatoes just enough so that they retain a bit of texture—we’re not looking for baby food here. For ease we mix the pie filling in a food processor, but if you don’t have one, you can easily achieve the result using a potato masher—just mash the cooked sweet potatoes in a separate mixing bowl before stirring in the remaining wet ingredients.We call for a frozen pie crust, but you can swap in our buttery Actually Perfect Pie Crust if you’re feeling super DIY and have a deep-dish pie pan. Either way, you’ll need to blind-bake it (read more in our guide to blind-baking; and make sure you pick up our favorite pie weights).If lining pecans into concentric circles gives you agita, or you happen to have a bag of chopped pecans or pecan pieces in the cupboard, feel free to skip the design and make the swap—you’ll need about 113 grams of pecans total. Top with slightly sweetened softly whipped cream or  a scoop of vanilla ice cream to gild the lily.For the full story behind this recipe, read this essay by Dolen Perkins-Valdez.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 9\"-diameter store-bought frozen deep-dish pie shell, thawed",

      "Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 375°. Line one 9\"-diameter store-bought frozen deep-dish pie shell, thawed, with 2 sheets of parchment paper, leaving overhang, and fill to edges with pie weights or dried beans. Set pie dish on a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake pie crust until edges are golden brown and bottom is opaque (carefully lift parchment to check), 20–25 minutes. Remove from oven; reduce oven temperature to 350°. Using overhang, lift out parchment and weights. Return pie crust to oven and bake until uniformly golden brown, 10–12 minutes.

    "title": "Bûche de Noël",
    "description": "Making this bûche de Noël is not for the faint of heart. It has four elements: chocolate sponge cake and a rich chestnut mousse filling for the Yule log base, silky dark chocolate buttercream for the bark, and meringue mushrooms to complete the look. It’s the Everest of Christmas desserts, but worth it if you’re a passionate project baker and looking to claim bragging rights this holiday season.You need to be strategic about your prep time, especially if it’s your first time making such an elaborate dessert. As cookbook author and certified bûche de Noël aficionado Claire Saffitz explains: “space the baking and decorating over several days. The mushrooms can be made 3 days ahead, the buttercream 2 days ahead, the roll 1 day ahead.” Then, all you have to do is garnish it with a dusting of freshly fallen snow (i.e., powdered sugar) before serving on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, or whenever you plan to celebrate.Note that this recipe uses a half-sheet pan to bake the cake, not a jelly roll pan, which is traditionally smaller in size. This does two things: Gives you a larger cake to share with more people, and saves you from buying another piece of equipment. (You’re welcome.)Rolling is the hardest part of making a Yule log cake, but a little oil helps to keep the sponge cake pliable even when cool. If this is the part where you can feel yourself getting stressed, follow Claire’s step-by-step tutorial and know that you can make this into a simpler Swiss roll cake with a whipped cream filling and a drizzle of melted chocolate ganache—or garnish with sugared cranberries (like the ones in this cranberry pie recipe), and it will still impress. Note: If you’re using whipped cream, don’t assemble your cake more than an hour in advance.",

    "title": "Cheesy Roasted Cabbage Wedges",
    "description": "While we won’t attempt to sway you into swapping out your turkey for a vegetable main, we will let this centerpiece-worthy cabbage do the talking for us. Coated in a generous amount of salty Parmesan cheese that crisps and blisters in the oven, savoy cabbage wedges transform into a showstopping main that can upstage even the flashiest of birds. The sauce—a cheesy, lemony cream—not only provides the perfect landing place for the cabbage wedges but works double duty in this recipe: Each cabbage wedge is brushed in the cheese sauce, then sprinkled with Parmesan before going into the oven. The sauce acts like a flavorful glue that keeps the wedges coated in a blanket of cheese. Any left over is heated and served below the wedges while a showering of chopped hazelnuts with parsley provides a contrasting texture and freshness that cuts through the richness. And for anyone wondering if they can swap out savoy cabbage for green: We don’t recommend it. Savoy cabbage is much drier than standard green varieties and ensures the wedges turn out crisp and golden instead of limp and mushy.",
    "ingredients": [
      "½ cup blanched hazelnuts",
      "1 Extra-virgin olive oil (for baking sheets)",
      "6 large head of savoy cabbage (about 3 lb.)",
      "1 oz. Gruyère, coarsely grated (about 1½ cups)",
      "1⅔ Tbsp. cornstarch",
      "2 cups (or more) heavy cream",
      "2 Tbsp. Dijon mustard",
      "1½ garlic cloves, finely grated",
      "1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest, divided",
      "1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more",
      "5 tsp. freshly ground pepper, plus more",
      "¼ oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about 3 cups), plus more for\nserving"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Place racks in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 350°. Toast ½ cup blanched hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop; set aside. Increase oven temperature to 375°.",
      "Generously coat 2 large rimmed baking sheets with extra-virgin olive oil. Cut 1 large head of savoy cabbage (about 3 lb.) in half through core; cut each half into 6–8 wedges, keeping core intact.",
      "Toss 6 oz. Gruyère, coarsely grated (about 1½ cups), and 1 Tbsp. cornstarch in a medium bowl to combine. Bring 1⅔ cups heavy cream, 2 Tbsp. Dijon mustard, 2 garlic cloves, finely grated, 1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and 1 tsp. freshly ground pepper to a simmer in a medium saucepan. Add Gruyère mixture a handful at a time, whisking after each addition until melted. Cook sauce, whisking constantly, until thick enough to coat a spoon, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Taste cheese sauce and season with more salt and/or pepper if needed.",
      "Working with one wedge at a time, brush cabbage on all sides with about half of cheese sauce. Sprinkle very generously on all sides with 5 oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about 3 cups), pressing to adhere. Divide wedges, cut sides down, between prepared baking sheets, spacing at least 1\" apart.",
      "Roast cabbage until beginning to brown on top, 30–35 minutes\n(don’t fret if stray bits of cheese on baking sheet burn slightly). Turn wedges over and\nrotate baking sheets top to bottom and front to back. Continue to roast until golden\nbrown in spots on the other side, 20–25 minutes longer.",

    "title": "Spice-Roasted Potato Wedges",
    "description": "Whether you dip them in ketchup, aioli, or a sour cream and pickle dipping sauce, these baked potato wedges are crispy, spicy, and a ridiculously easy option for a weeknight side dish or game-day appetizer. Unlike when you make french fries, you won’t need to parboil, vent your whole kitchen, or use a copious amount of paper towels.Achieving crispy potato wedges comes down to providing the spuds with the right conditions—high heat and no excess water. Line your baking tray with foil, not parchment paper, which can keep the cut potatoes from browning. Make sure they don’t overlap; a single layer means more of the cut sides will touch the pan and get crispy. Meanwhile, use the cooking time to make a quick dinner or pair the potatoes with a salad and a store-bought rotisserie chicken.To prep the potatoes ahead, slice them and submerge them in cold water. Keep them immersed and refrigerated until you’re ready to roast (up to 24 hours), but dry them well before adding to the oil and spices.This recipe for potato wedges is highly adaptable. Looking for something less spicy? Use sweet smoked paprika (instead of a hot variety) and ditch the cayenne. Out of garlic powder? Onion powder will do the trick. Want to top the cooked potatoes with a cloud of Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of fresh parsley? Go for it.Looking for more crispy potato recipes? Try sweet potato fries with creamy sriracha dip, air-fried potatoes with tahini yogurt, mashed Yukon Golds with fried potato skins, and more.",

      "Pour 1 cup vegetable oil into another medium Dutch oven or heavy pot (it should come about ½\" up sides); fit with thermometer and heat over medium-high. Add bean mixture and cook, stirring and scraping bottom and sides of pot with a heatproof rubber spatula, until homogeneous and emulsified, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat; cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly onto surface (this will prevent a skin from forming).",
      "Season 1 lb. tuna steaks, patted dry, cut into 1\" pieces, with salt, then place in a medium bowl. Add ¼ cup (45 g) rice flour or cornstarch; toss to coat. Pour fresh oil into reserved skillet with fat to come 1\" up sides. Fit with thermometer and heat until thermometer registers about 400°. Working in batches, cook tuna, tossing constantly, until lightly crisped on the outside but still a little pink in the center, about 30 seconds per batch. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt.",
      "Scoop beans onto plates and smooth into an even layer; top with tuna, drained pickled onion, and microgreens or cilantro. Serve with warmed tortillas and lime wedges."

    "title": "Shoofly Pie",
    "description": "Unless you or your grandparents are from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, there’s a solid chance you’ve only ever heard of shoofly pie. But tasted one? You can’t quite remember. An often overlooked regional American specialty popular in Amish country and in the Mennonite community, it’s believed shoofly pie (sometimes spelled shoe-fly pie) was first made by the Pennsylvania Dutch. However, they likely got the idea from English ex-pats who swapped molasses into their beloved treacle tarts. The origin of its name is also somewhat murky; according to The Oxford Companion to Food, it likely comes from bakers having to shoo away flies from the pie plate.Shoofly pies are divided into two camps: wet bottom and dry bottom. The former is a crumb pie with a thick, gooey layer of molasses, while the latter is more akin to a coffee cake baked into a pie crust. This one from Wendy Jo’s, a long-standing Lancaster bakery in the city’s Central Market, falls squarely into the wet bottom camp.Her recipe makes enough pie dough for two 9\" pies, but you can easily freeze half of it. If you don’t have much experience with molasses, know that it comes in a few varieties: light molasses (or baking molasses) is the sweetest, while blackstrap molasses is the most robust. For this pie filling, unsulfured baking molasses is best (read more about the types of molasses). Let the pie cool nearly to room temperature (just slightly warm is best) so the molasses mixture has time to set.Looking for more pie recipes?

    "title": "Smoked Turkey With Spicy BBQ Rub",
    "description": "Let this be the year you “volunteer” to take the cooking outside. This smoked turkey recipe promises a perfectly burnished bird, encrusted with the smoky-sweet flavor of a BBQ-inspired brown sugar rub. It’s a streamlined dish that doesn’t require a fussy turkey brine recipe or necessitate adding cold water to a roasting pan so the drippings don’t burn. But the real reward will be the peace and quiet granted unto you by the great outdoors.Whether you’re working with a gas grill, charcoal grill, or smoker, this whole-turkey recipe has you covered. You can coat the outside of the turkey with the dry rub up to two days in advance of your Thanksgiving dinner. If you’re using a frozen turkey, allow it to thaw at least 24 hours, then pat it dry with paper towels before coating with the turkey rub. (Follow the Epicurious guide for more intel on how to thaw a turkey.)We call for hickory wood here for its balanced level of smoke, but if you happen to have more delicate cherry or apple wood on hand, feel free to use it. Avoid mesquite, which can be too strong for smoking poultry.Interested in a spatchcocked bird? Try this Grilled Turkey Under a Brick.

    "title": "Biscuits and Sausage Gravy",
    "description": "Let’s be clear: There is no one perfect homemade biscuits and gravy recipe. The Southern comfort food, typically served at breakfast, comes with a hefty dose of nostalgia and controversy. Many folks from the American South will attest that their family makes the best biscuits. Some swear only White Lily flour can be used as the base of the flour mixture; others have strong opinions about butter versus lard and how the dough should be shaped. And there are those for whom only Jimmy Dean pork sausage will do in their gravy. In short: biscuits and gravy is personal. Our recipe turns out warm flaky biscuits and a rich creamy gravy.If it’s your first time making biscuits, don’t let all this scare you off. The technique is simple: Repeatedly folding and rolling the biscuit dough yields lots of flaky individuated layers that pull apart neatly when you eat them. While buttermilk biscuits may be the most iconic variety, this recipe replaces the buttermilk with a mixture of sour cream and whole milk, which means it’s easy to throw together on a whim, even if you don’t keep buttermilk on hand.As for the homemade sausage gravy (sometimes called sawmill gravy), breakfast sausage adds flavor and its fat helps bring the gravy together on the stovetop. While you can store leftover gravy in an airtight container and reheat it, it’s best the day it’s made, so don’t hold back when serving.Watch Bon Appetit food director Chris Morocco try to reverse engineer Edna Lewis’s buttermilk biscuits and gravy from taste and find more breakfast recipes like hash browns and a no-flip blueberry pancake made in a large skillet.",

    "title": "Roasted Sweet Potatoes With Triple-Cream Cheese",
    "description": "Years ago chef John Yelinek accidentally left a batch of sweet potatoes baking in the back of a hot oven. Now this is his favorite way of getting crispy, charred skins and custardy interiors. At Ladder 4 Wine Bar in Detroit, MI—one of our Best New Restaurants of 2023—the soft sweet potatoes serve as a base for spiced seeds and heaps of cheese.At home, a moderate hour-long roast gets the job done (but if you happen to “forget” about them for another hour, all the better). Scrub, but don’t pierce—and definitely don’t peel—the sweet potato skins; they act as an incubator, allowing the insides to transform from rock hard to yieldingly gooey.The pumpkin seed dukkah is meant to act as a savory granola. Keep it coarse and barely broken down for optimal textural contrast.

    "title": "Cottage Cheese Lasagna",
    "description": "Cottage cheese is a fighter. It makes you pick sides—you’re either all in or you’re up in arms. If you grew up seeing cottage cheese as something dietetic, this cottage cheese lasagna might rock your beliefs. The quintessential curds and whey make a handsome stand-in for the ricotta cheese used in a lot of homemade lasagna recipes. Thanks to its defined small curds, cottage cheese stays moist instead of turning chalky as ricotta is prone to do after an extended cooking time.To round out the cheese layer, I mix in super-melter Fontina cheese (spring for an aged Fontina for even richer flavor) and nutty, savory Parmesan cheese. Yes, this lasagna eschews shredded mozzarella cheese, but I promise you won’t miss it.A combo of Italian sausage and ground beef provides an ideal balance of flavor and texture to the meat sauce. Save the lean ground beef for another time. The resulting fat from an 80% blend is just enough to enrich the pasta sauce, making it possible to use cans of crushed tomatoes instead of pricier store-bought spaghetti sauce or marinara sauce. If you don’t eat beef or pork, feel free to swap in ground turkey and turkey sausage, but you might need an extra drizzle of olive oil to make up for the lost fat.A generous amount of Worcestershire sauce and tomato paste brings intense depth and long-cooked flavor to the tomato sauce that is—surprise!—barely cooked. Retaining moisture in the sauce is key since the extra liquid gets soaked up by the uncooked lasagna noodles as the casserole bakes. That’s right, this cottage cheese lasagna ensures perfectly al dente pasta without the need to boil noodles.Between the cottage cheese mixture and the no-cook noodles, this might not be your nonna’s traditional lasagna (we’ve got BA’s Best Lasagna recipe for that), but it’s absolutely one the whole family will enjoy, whether they think they like cottage cheese or not.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Risotto",
    "description": "This simple creamy risotto recipe stands on its own. Yes, you can serve it as a side dish, but it’s a main event, worthy of a dinner party even. If this is your first time making the Italian rice dish, know it’s a bit like a clingy baby, explains former BA food director Carla Lalli Music. “You can’t walk away from it,” she says, but “if you give it all your patient attention, it will transform into a puddle of love.” This isn’t the dish to make when you have a million other things going on—risotto’s cook time is all active: Stirring the rice constantly helps produce its signature creamy texture.You can use any short-grain rice variety to make risotto. Carnaroli or arborio rice are the most common, but you may see boxes labeled generically as “risotto rice.” The latter should be fine, but check the label to make sure it isn’t preseasoned or otherwise flavored. In a pinch, even sushi rice will work. Toast the rice grains in oil to ensure you end up with al dente rice with distinct grains suspended in a creamy sauce, not a mushy porridge. For straightforward flavor, Carla recommends using salted water, not store-bought vegetable broth or chicken stock, which can vary significantly from brand to brand.You can finish the recipe simply with Parmesan cheese and a garnish of black pepper—plus a sprinkling of fresh parsley if you like. But risotto makes an excellent canvas for seasonal ingredients. We’ve listed a few variations below, but don’t let these restrict you. Top your risotto with a pile of roasted carrots, flaked grilled salmon and a drizzle of romesco sauce, a simple poached egg, or any other toppings you can dream up.Risotto is best the moment it’s ready, but you can make it ahead to a point. Reserve 2–3 cups of the salted water, cool the undercooked risotto, and store both in the refrigerator for up to three days. To finish, warm the risotto over medium-low, bring the water to a simmer, and continue with the recipe as written. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container and reheat them with a bit of water over medium-low heat, or even better, form them into arancini.",

      "Combine 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt and 10 cups water in a medium stockpot. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce to medium heat and maintain a bare simmer.",
      "Meanwhile, heat 6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a 6-qt. Dutch oven over medium. Cook ½ large white onion, finely chopped (about 1½ cups) and a pinch of salt, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent and starting to soften, 6–8 minutes. Add ½ cup water and cook, stirring often, until water evaporates and onion is sizzling in oil and completely tender, about 5 minutes. (Adding the water allows the onion to cook gently and thoroughly without taking on any color.) Taste onion; if it’s still firm at all, add another splash of water and continue cooking until meltingly soft.",
      "Add 2 cups carnaroli, arborio, or Japanese sushi rice to cooked onions and stir well to coat with oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until grains of rice are translucent around the edges and they make a glassy clattering sound when they hit the sides and bottom of pot, about 5 minutes. Coating the grains with oil before adding any liquid helps the rice cook evenly so that the outside does not become mushy before the center is tender. Add 1 cup dry white wine and another pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine is completely evaporated, about 2 minutes.",
      "Reduce heat to medium, then add hot salted water to rice in ¾-cup increments, stirring constantly and allowing liquid to absorb fully before adding more, until rice is al dente and surrounded by fluid, not-too-thick creamy suspension, 25–30 minutes. It should take 2–3 minutes for each addition to be absorbed; if things are moving faster than this, reduce heat to medium-low. Gradual absorption and constant agitation are the keys to cooking risotto, encouraging the starches to release from the rice and transforming into the dish’s trademark creamy consistency. You may not need all of the hot water, but err on the side of soup rather than sludge. The finished texture should be more of a liquid than a solid. Start checking the rice after about 15 minutes; the grains should be tender but not mushy, with a slightly firm center that doesn’t leave a chalky or bitty residue between your teeth after tasting.",
      "Remove pot from heat, add 5 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces, and stir until melted. Gradually add 1¼ cups Parmesan, stirring until cheese is melted and liquid surrounding risotto is creamy but very fluid. Stir in more hot salted water if needed to achieve the right consistency. Taste and season with salt.",

    "title": "Seafood Chowder",
    "description": "What makes this one of the best seafood chowder recipes we’ve seen? It’s incredibly adaptable and produces a New England–style chowder that’s deeply flavorful yet light and decidedly not gloppy.The recipe comes from Larsen’s Fish Market, a tiny seafood shack on Martha’s Vineyard. Instead of using salt pork or bacon, the team doubles down on flavors from the sea with clam juice, seafood or fish stock, shellfish, and white fish. Consider the ingredient list general guidance, not set in stone: While swordfish or sea bass is preferable, you can use haddock, cod, or whatever flaky white fish you’ve got on hand; if you can’t swing lobster, opt for a few extra large shrimp, or toss in some mussels or clams. For the potatoes, any variety—including Yukon Golds or red potatoes—will work nicely. Don’t have half-and-half? Swap in a combination of whole milk and heavy cream in equal proportion. Out of sherry? Use mirin, dry vermouth, or a dry white wine—or a squeeze of lemon juice if you prefer an alcohol-free option.Instead of starting this seafood soup with a roux, as is traditional, you’ll make the flour-butter-broth mixture on the side and add it to the almost-finished pot. Stir it in gradually, just until the broth reaches exactly the consistency you crave. Garnish the creamy seafood chowder with oyster crackers and serve with a cold beer or glass of chilled white wine.Looking for more seafood soup recipes? Try a fish chowder with coconut milk, a dairy-free corn chowder with clams, or a classic New England clam chowder.",

    "title": "Banana Cream Pie",
    "description": "Trust us when we say that everything that makes this showstopping banana cream pie recipe infinitely impressive is also what makes it so easy to pull off. From the salty-sweet graham cracker crust to the sky-high mountain of peanut-blanketed homemade whipped cream to the yolk-yellow filling bursting with fresh banana flavor, you’d be fooling yourself—and your guests—if you thought it was hard to make.A food processor helps with the pie crust, which requires just four ingredients, including melted butter for richness and peanuts for extra crunch. Baking the crust yields multiple benefits: It toasts the nuts and grahams for depth of flavor, and it melts the sugar, which, when cooled, helps to hold the crumbs together. After it comes out of the oven, you’ll have a few seconds to adjust any slumping or other imperfections before the crust begins to set in the pie plate.While some recipes build the pie filling out of a box of vanilla pudding mix, we take the old-school route, mixing up a flavorful vanilla custard on the stovetop before folding in sliced bananas and tipping the filling into the pie shell. It takes at least two hours for the custard to set; if you’re making it a day ahead of time, cover the pie with plastic wrap or wax paper while chilling to prevent a film from forming on the surface. Just before serving, beat sweetened heavy cream to a soft texture shy of stiff peaks and carefully mound it on top of the pie. The final shower of crunchy chopped salted peanuts is more than just a garnish—it provides texture in a way that crushed vanilla wafers never could.This homemade banana cream pie is best made with ripe but firm bananas. If you’re looking to use up an overripe, mushy bunch, consider BA’s Best Banana Bread or this double-banana layer cake. Taking dessert to a potluck? This cream-cheese-laced banana pudding is highly transportable.",

    "title": "Côte de Bœuf au Poivre",
    "description": "This côte de bœuf recipe comes from MaMou, a modern brasserie in New Orleans and one of our Best New Restaurants of 2023, where executive chef Thomas Branighan reimagines classic French dishes using the Creole influences picked up throughout his Southern Louisiana upbringing. This hearty bone-in ribeye steak recipe is one of the restaurant’s most showstopping main courses, served with a quick pan sauce punctuated with a symphony of peppercorns and the subtle kick of sweet pepper jelly. Using the reverse-searing technique—always a clever move for large cuts of beef—Branighan slow-roasts the steak until its core temperature reaches his desired doneness, then sears it quickly on the stovetop over high heat to develop a crust. This controlled method allows for a more precise cook time, lessening the risk of under- or over-cooking the rib of beef and ensuring a deeply caramelized crust. (It also means you don’t have to worry about leaving a piece of meat out at room temperature hours before you’re ready to cook.)The creamy sauce is fortified with apple brandy and grounded by the intense savoriness of the restaurant’s housemade demi-glace. In place of the latter ingredient, we used condensed beef stock (a.k.a. Better Than Bouillon), a home cook-friendly shortcut that mimics Branighan’s prized demi. Our version is seasoned with three types of peppercorns (green, pink, and white), each adding its own unique character. White peppercorns are a stand-in for the Balinese variety, prized for its piquant flavor with notes of cinnamon and cardamom, used at MaMou. If you care to source Balinese peppercorns—sometimes called long pepper—replace the white pepper with 1 Tbsp. finely ground Balinese pepper.Branighan serves his perfect côte de bœuf with a side dish of exceedingly silky pommes puree; a dairy-rich canvas that lets the peppery sauce shine. At home, classic mashed potatoes would be equally welcomed.Note: If you can’t find a bone-in ribeye steak you can use a boneless prime rib steak in its place. Start checking the steak after 20 minutes in the oven as a boneless steak will cook faster.",

    "title": "Spicy Salmon Roll Bowl",
    "description": "Consider this spicy salmon rice bowl recipe your favorite sushi, deconstructed. Using your broiler to cook mayo-coated pieces of salmon keeps the cook time low (and eliminates the need to seek out pricey sushi-grade fish). The direct high heat allows the bite-size salmon pieces to develop a crispy exterior in very little time, without the splatter of a stovetop, for a hearty, easy weeknight dinner.Pair the cooked salmon bites with sliced avocado, quick-pickled cucumber (if you have trouble finding the Persian variety, a single English cucumber also works), and a shower of flavorful garnishes like nori-studded furikake, chile-flecked shichimi togarashi, toasted sesame seeds, and green onions. Zigzagging spicy mayo over the top (use a zip-top sandwich bag with the corner snipped off or a reusable squeeze bottle) isn’t required but definitely recommended; we like the texture of an oil-based chile crisp (such as Lao Gan Ma) here, but sriracha will do in a pinch. Because each component of the bowl is seasoned, no other adornments are necessary, but a drizzle of salty soy sauce or nutty sesame oil wouldn’t be out of place.While short-grain sushi rice most closely mirrors the Japanese roll this spicy salmon bowl references, you can substitute another white rice—or use brown rice, cauliflower rice, or even another grain like farro or quinoa if you prefer.",

    "title": "Almost-Classic Sweet Potato Casserole",
    "description": "Some say the best sweet potato casserole recipe must include a marshmallow topping; others remain true to a buttery streusel or toasty brown-sugar pecan topping. While I firmly believe that crunchy contrast is vital to this silky, smooth Thanksgiving recipe, there’s one small problem: I’m allergic to nuts.My sweet potato casserole recipe swaps the pecans for a crispy, sweet, and salty cornflake streusel topping. Just combine cornflakes, brown sugar, salt, and melted butter in a resealable plastic bag and shake. The toasted breakfast cereal perfectly complements the sweet potato purée. And the marshmallows stay. Add pecans if you must—but trust me, you won’t miss them.Instead of boiling the spuds or relying on canned sweet potatoes, as many versions of the classic Thanksgiving recipe instruct, I roast fresh sweet potatoes until tender, which concentrates their flavor instead of washing it down the drain. (Get some prep time out of the way by roasting the potatoes up to three days in advance.) For the silkiest purée, skip the potato masher and give the cooked sweet potatoes a whiz in the food processor.Note: If you’re making this for someone gluten-free, check the label on the cereal box; some brands contain malt syrup or malt extract, neither suitable for a gluten-free diet.Get more of our best Thanksgiving dinner recipes, including green bean casserole, candied yams, and cranberry sauce.

    "title": "The Easiest Glazed Carrots",
    "description": "This glazed carrots recipe is the perfect thing to make when you’re about to sit down to Thanksgiving dinner and realize you need just one more side dish. It requires a single skillet, a handful of ingredients you likely already have on hand—not just for the holiday season but any time of year—and comes together in about 15 minutes. In fact, it’s so easy, we bet you’ll keep it in the rotation for many weeknight dinners to come.The glaze combines fresh orange juice, honey, butter, and freshly grated ginger, which you’ll cook with the carrots until the sauce is reduced and caramelized. A splash of water restores the mixture to a sticky, bright, buttery glaze that clings to the glistening veg. This recipe is adaptable too. Don’t have any honey? Swap in maple syrup or brown sugar. No OJ? White wine, apple juice, or stock will work. Used all your ginger in the cranberry chutney? Add the zest of a lemon and finish with lemon juice instead of water. And if you need a vegan option for the butter, a plant-based version or coconut oil will do just fine. If you bought whole carrots with the greens still attached, feel free to use those as garnish in place of fresh parsley. And while we can’t endorse baby carrots, this recipe adapts to whatever you might have around.Store any leftovers in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to three days, but don’t bother reheating them. The cold candied carrots make a fantastic salty-sweet-savory topping for yogurt.For more easy side dish recipes, consider these roasted carrot coins with thyme, baked sweet potato fries with a spicy dip—or go all out with our favorite recipe for mashed potatoes.",

    "description": "Cocktails often come with a hefty dose of lore and legend—we may never know who poured the first mai tai, for instance. The cosmopolitan cocktail is no exception.Before Sex and the City made it a national sensation, the pink drink was popular in the queer communities of Provincetown and San Francisco. Legendary bartender Dale DeGroff and a Miami woman named Cheryl Cook are often credited with inventing the modern cosmo recipe. But Toby Cecchini, who owns Long Island Bar in Brooklyn, seems to have the most plausible story from his days bartending at New York icon The Odeon.As he told former BA editor Priya Krishna in an oral history of the drink, a colleague’s friends were visiting from San Francisco in the late 1980s and showed them the drink. “It was gross, but it looked pretty,” Cecchini recalled. He reconstructed it with Absolut Citron vodka, Cointreau, fresh lime juice, and cranberry juice to approximate Rose’s grenadine. The drink became a hit with the staff and their celebrity and downtown Manhattan clientele.A classic cosmopolitan recipe—like this one—should be vibrantly hued and sweet from a “cranberry juice cocktail” like Ocean Spray (a bottle labeled 100% cranberry juice will be too tart here). The drink should have a floral citrus note from a triple sec (like Cointreau) or another orange liqueur and a refreshing tang. The type of cocktail glass is also crucial: Only a martini glass will do. (However, we will also accept a coupe.)Check out more classic cocktail recipes like an extra-dry martini with a lemon twist, a Moscow mule, and a negroni.",

      "Combine 2 oz. vodka, 1 oz. cranberry juice cocktail, ¾ oz fresh lime juice, and ¾ oz. triple sec in a cocktail shaker. Fill shaker with ice, cover, and shake vigorously until outside of shaker is very cold, about 20 seconds.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Sugar Cookies",
    "description": "Our favorite sugar cookie recipe yields a workable dough you can transform into cutouts that hold their shape in the heat of the oven and emerge crisp-yet-tender canvases, ready for decorating. We love this Easy Sugar Cookie Icing (a riff on royal icing, made with powdered sugar and egg whites) tinted with vibrant food coloring powder for gilding the tops of the buttery cookies. If you’d like to pull out all the stops for a decorating party, load up on sanding sugars, sprinkles, and dragées. Or forget all that and turn them into sandwiches filled with chocolate buttercream or cream cheese frosting instead.To start, you’ll cream butter and granulated sugar just to combine, and not until it’s “light and fluffy.” Unlike many cookie recipes, you don’t want to whip too much air into the butter, which could make the cookies spread—not the goal here. And yes, you’re using chilled butter, not room temperature, making the whole process go much faster. Add a little peppermint or almond extract to the cookie batter if you’d like to play with the flavors, but no more than ¼ tsp. of either; they’re much more potent than vanilla.Rolling out your dough between two sheets of parchment (or silicone baking mats) guarantees this easy sugar cookie recipe is as supreme (and easily made) as its name suggests, as thinly rolled cookie dough can stick to even the coldest countertops. To make your work and cleanup easier, line your cookie sheets with more parchment, but don’t be tempted to swap in silicone for the baking. While we’re all for no waste, super-slippery silicone mats encourage spreading, which, again, is not the goal here.If decorating with sanding sugar, sprinkle it on the unbaked cookies before they go into the oven. If decorating with icing or glaze, make sure the cookies are completely cool before decorating. You can bake the cookies up to 12 hours ahead and leave them on cooling racks, loosely covered with a kitchen towel. Finally, be sure to add any sprinkles or other adornments before the icing has set.If you’re thinking of assembling a cookie tin, we recommend pairing these with another classic like chocolate chip cookies and a couple of bolder options like chewy molasses cookies or ancho-mole cookies. Store decorated cookies in an airtight container for up to 3 days.",

    "title": "Crispy Baked Tofu Nuggets",
    "description": "Frozen chicken nuggets were a staple of my childhood. Warm and toasty, with a supercharged flavor, they still elicit a sharp pang of nostalgia, just like the Zoo Pals plates my mom served them on. These days I eat less meat, so you won’t find them in my kitchen anymore, but you will find something even better: these thrillingly easy baked tofu nuggets.Firm or medium-firm tofu both work here; just try to avoid extra-firm tofu, which has a drier texture. No need to press the block—you want the baked tofu to maintain some moisture. Instead of cutting the tofu into neat cubes, tear apart the block into generous hunks with your hands. Those nooks and crannies add lots of texture and spots for the seasoning to stick.Consider this recipe a flexible formula: equal parts flour, starch, and nutritional yeast, plus some seasoning. I’ve made these nuggets with all-purpose flour or rice flour (which makes them gluten-free), plus cornstarch or potato starch. Any combo works, so feel free to use what you’ve got in the cabinet. And no need to flip mid-bake—leaving them be lets the tofu nuggets get extra crisp on the bottom, just like the ones you used to heat up in the toaster oven.If you’re feeding a larger family, this crispy baked tofu recipe easily doubles. Serve with lots of dipping sauce: ketchup, honey mustard, ranch, or any condiment your heart desires.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Breakfast Sausage",
    "description": "While breakfast sausages like those from Jimmy Dean are ubiquitous at American grocery stores, ditching store-bought in favor of your own sausage blend is easy and supremely worthwhile. Plus, it opens up a world of customization. If you don’t eat pork or you’re simply not into pork sausage, swap in ground beef or ground turkey (dark meat, please). Out of fresh thyme and sage? Substitute 1 tsp. each of the dried herbs, as writer Alyse Whitney suggests in her ode to this recipe, or a couple shakes of your favorite herb-and-spice blend. Unlike the Italian sausage you would use in a ragù, breakfast sausage should be a bit sweet and pack a little heat, but if you like it sweeter or hotter, you can tweak the amount of sugar and chile flakes you add to the ground meat. You could also swap in maple syrup or honey to change up the flavor. Or, for an extra spicy sausage, add a bit of cayenne pepper.Unlike burger patties, which require a gentle hand, you really want to work the meat here. You’re looking to emulsify the fat with the flavorings. For best results, ask your butcher to run a fresh piece of pork shoulder through the meat grinder and keep it cold until you’re ready to mix.To make your mornings easier, take care of the prep time in advance. You can shape the patties and refrigerate them in an airtight container for up to two days or freeze them for a month. Serve the cooked sausage patties with fried eggs and toast, crumble them up for the best-ever sausage gravy, or slide them into a breakfast sandwich with English muffins, eggs, and American cheese.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Apple Pie",
    "description": "This recipe for homemade apple pie delivers on every front. It’s got a perfectly flaky pie crust, no soggy bottom in sight, and a filling loaded with thinly sliced apples enrobed in a saucy (not gloopy or runny) glaze, hit with just the right amount of warming spice.You’ll need a deep-dish pie plate to hold the four pounds of fruit packed in here, and we suggest being extra choosy when selecting apples for pie. Opt for sweet-tart firm baking apples like Pink Lady, Honeycrisp, Braeburn, or Jonagold in the fall, when apples are in season. The rest of the year, look to tart, reliable Granny Smith apples—and don’t be afraid to use multiple varieties in a single pie (in fact, we encourage it). Some apple varieties have tough skins, so we recommend peeling them all; if you know your apples are thin-skinned (and you know you like the texture of baked apple skin), feel free to leave the peels intact.You’ll amp up the flavor of your pie with a syrup made from reduced apple cider steeped with a vanilla bean and a whisper of cinnamon, allspice, and cardamom (just enough to enhance the fruit but not overwhelm it). If you’d rather swap in vanilla extract, add 1 Tbsp to the apple pie filling just before scraping it into the pie pan. To finish, sprinkle demerara sugar over the top of the pie for extra sparkle and crunch.Pastry chef and former BA senior food editor Claire Saffitz explains this apple pie recipe is “something you can’t rush.” It requires ample chilling, baking, and resting, so plan accordingly, particularly if you’re making it for Thanksgiving. Thankfully, like pecan and pumpkin pie, it can be made a full day in advance.Looking for a different apple dessert?

    "title": "Spatchcock Turkey With Anise and Orange",
    "description": "There are many (many!) Thanksgiving turkey recipes out there. But this roast spatchcock turkey recipe with its aniseed, orange, and fresh herb dry brine is, as former BA test kitchen director Carla Lalli Music put it, “for people who want a turkey that actually tastes good, not a turkey that just looks good.” (Watch her make this recipe.)Butterflying or spatchcocking a whole turkey (i.e., removing the backbone and flattening the bird) has a multitude of benefits: It creates more surface area, thereby exposing more turkey skin to direct heat—and greater skin exposure means more opportunity for crispy skin. It also lets the white and dark meat cook evenly, so everything stays juicy, and it significantly cuts the overall cooking time.Most butchers will remove the backbone if you ask, but this video shows you how to spatchcock a 12–14-lb. turkey step by step if you want to DIY (make two if you have a big group). If you’re using a frozen bird, you must thaw it first, and if you don’t have sharp kitchen shears or poultry shears, now is the time to buy some.There’s no need to wake up early for this recipe; all told, the prep time and cooking time combined is just about 90 minutes (though note you will need to be on hand as the turkey cooks to baste it). To test for doneness, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh and breast and look for an internal temperature of 165°. Cover the cooked turkey with  foil for 30 minutes before carving so the juices stay put. (Meanwhile, make a killer turkey gravy from the drippings.)That’s it. Now you have the rest of the day to finish your Thanksgiving side dishes, set the table, or simply pour yourself a drink and admire perfection.",
    "ingredients": [
      "5 tsp. aniseed",

    "title": "A Simple Turkey Brine",
    "description": "Brining a whole turkey in a combination of salt, sugar, and aromatics is the key to flavorful Thanksgiving turkey with juicy meat. Truly, it’s the one and only path to truly succulent roast turkey breasts. But there are two ways to go: Should you dry-brine or wet-brine?For this wet-brine recipe you’ll need a large stockpot or food-safe 5-gal. bucket and space for it in your refrigerator. If you’re using a frozen turkey, you can defrost it during the brining process, but be sure to remove the giblets as soon as the turkey is thawed enough to do so. When using such a high ratio of salt, the brand you use matters. We rely on Diamond Crystal in the BA test kitchen, but we’ve also given measurements below for Morton. Check out Epicurious’s guide to salt for a chart outlining how these compare to other brands—or just measure by weight.You’ll bring the brining solution to a boil to dissolve the salt and sugar before tossing in the remaining brine ingredients, then chill the mixture until it’s cold. Don’t rush this by adding ice or cold water to the mix prematurely—the aromatics need time in the warm salt water for their flavor to infuse. We’ve suggested a basic mix of carrots, celery, and onion, but you should feel free to toss anything you want into the pot: A couple of garlic cloves or a halved apple, orange, or lemon; swap out the thyme for fresh rosemary, sage, or any mix of fresh herbs you like; add in a teaspoon of allspice berries or whole cumin or coriander seeds, along with the whole peppercorns; and generally add whatever other flavors sound good to you.You can also play around with the liquids: Replace up to half the water with apple juice, apple cider, cranberry juice, or unsweetened tea—or add up to a cup of white wine. The best turkey brine is the one that tastes like the holiday to you. For the most flavorful bird, count on a brining time of 3 days, followed by 1 day out of the salt solution so that the skin has time to dry out (crispy skin won’t happen otherwise). Pat the brined turkey dry with paper towels before transferring it breast side up to a roasting pan. And if you plan to make gravy from the drippings, taste before adding salt since the turkey fat will be highly seasoned.No space for wet-brining? Try a dry-brined turkey with brown sugar, fresh rosemary, and grated orange peel.",

    "title": "Raspberry Jell-O Salad",
    "description": "Most references to classic American Jell-O salad will have you believing it’s a dinosaur, once popular and now extinct. A monstrous mishmash of seemingly disjointed ingredients ranging from crushed pineapple to mini marshmallows to chopped pecans to canned mandarin oranges to cottage cheese, all spackled in Cool Whip. But Jell-O salad is alive and well—thriving even. And yes, it can be delicious. Fans are still out here, sharing grandma’s vintage “fluff salad” recipe at potlucks and get-togethers. And sometimes even at work, which is how this raspberry Jell-O salad recipe first made the rounds in the BA test kitchen. As it passed from editor to editor, the dish was declared “yummy,” “elegant,” and “shockingly good.” Such is the power of jiggly gelatin.The recipe is based on one from former senior commerce editor MacKenzie Chung Fegan, who inherited the retro family favorite through marriage. At first dubious, she soon grew to love the gelatin salad that showed up year after year on her in-laws’ holiday table. Crammed with sweet-tart raspberries, a thick layer of whipped cream cheese, and a buttery graham cracker crisp, it’s destined to convert doubters. And the kicker? It’s relatively quick and easy to make.Dropping whole, still-frozen raspberries into the hot gelatin cools the liquid rapidly and defrosts the berries. (The fruit will stay remarkably well preserved for up to 2 days.) If you’re not a fan of raspberry, feel free to use another flavored gelatin and fruit combination. Go for frozen cherries suspended in cherry Jell-O, or mix and match with wild blueberries and cranberry or strawberry Jell-O.To avoid a lumpy whipped topping, the cream cheese must be at room temperature. Too cold and it won’t be smooth; too hot and the cream won’t whip. To cut down on prep time, microwave the unwrapped block in 10-second bursts just until softened.Revelers may never agree on whether this wobbly wonder is a side dish, fruit salad, or full-blown dessert, but one thing’s for sure: Once you add it to your annual holiday meal, there’s no going back.Looking for more Jell-O salad variations? This strawberry Jell-O salad from Epicurious is basically a no-bake cheesecake with a pretzel crust and fresh strawberries, while this elegant riff on ambrosia salad gets a dose of cream sherry.",

    "title": "Simply Brilliant Banoffee Pie",
    "description": "With its appealing combination of just-ripe-enough bananas, toffee, and heaps of fluffy whipped cream, this classic British dessert deserves a place at your table. Many recipes call for canned dulce de leche, but our filling relies on a chewy homemade caramel sauce, which adds a smoky allure and intensity that you won’t get otherwise. Combining burnt sugar with butter, then stirring in store-bought sweetened condensed milk, creates an eye-rolling-good pie filling that cuts cleanly into beautiful slices. We also tossed in a layer of salted nuts (peanuts or cashews), which gives the toffee a PayDay candy bar vibe; feel free to leave them out if you prefer.Sturdy digestive biscuits make the traditional cookie crust for this cream pie, but plain old graham crackers are a ready substitute. Use a food processor to ensure the crackers are crushed to fine crumbs, then pulse in melted butter and a bit of sugar. The sugar melts during the pie crust’s quick bake, helping hold the graham cracker crumbs together. (If you must use a rolling pin to crush the grahams, know that doing so will result in larger, more irregular pieces that are more likely to crumble when sliced—not a deal breaker, but not the best experience.)Choose ripe bananas that are fully yellow with maybe a spot or two of brown speckles. Steer clear of fruit with hints of green (too starchy) or one with too many spots (too mushy). As for the crowning glory, the addition of sour cream and instant vanilla pudding mix easily transforms a puddle of cold heavy cream into a flavorful cloud, its texture almost like whipped cheesecake. Aim for firm peaks (just shy of stiff peaks). The homemade whipped cream provides enough drama in this banoffee pie recipe, but, should you want a few dark chocolate shavings (made with a Y-peeler and a bar of chocolate), a dusting of cocoa powder, or more sliced bananas perched atop the cream, all make for a fine garnish.",

Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl until firm peaks form, about 5 minutes.",
      "Using a small offset spatula, spread whipped cream mixture over pie, making sure to cover bananas completely and swirling to create dramatic peaks and swoops. Chill, uncovered, until caramel is set and pie is very cold, at least 2 hours and up to 4 hours."

    "title": "Classic Brined and Roasted Turkey",
    "description": "This brined turkey recipe from Alton Brown has you completely covered—starting with a frozen 14-18-pound bird and ending with a golden brown, succulent, and flavorful turkey, plus a rich gravy.Brown uses the wet-brine method here but frees you from the hassle of fitting a large stockpot in your fridge—tucking the bird into a cooler saves precious space. A bonus: You can thaw your turkey in the same cooler before introducing the brine. Like all recipes for roasted whole turkey, this one requires some planning, so schedule accordingly.A few crucial things to keep in mind: First, drying the bird well after brining is key to crispy skin. Brown also starts his turkey on high heat (500°), which helps dry out the skin and get it well on its way to golden. After the initial blast of heat, you’ll tent the breast with foil, turn down the oven, and then totally ignore it for the next hour and a half. That’s right: There’s no basting during the cooking time, leaving your hands free to focus on sweet potatoes, apple pie, and all those other Thanksgiving classics.The turkey will be a hit (seriously, check the reviews), but if you and your guests haven’t finished the whole bird by the night’s end, put it to work in these Thanksgiving turkey leftover recipes. If your idea of the best turkey brine recipe involves brown sugar and sprigs of fresh rosemary, try this dry-brine turkey.

    "title": "Cheesy Corn Pudding",
    "description": "Is it a savory, earthy cornbread or a sweet, custardy pudding? The answer is yes. Worlds collide in this easy corn pudding recipe, resulting in a spoonable one-bowl wonder laced with melted butter and cheddar cheese. This style of corn pudding is a staple side dish at holiday dinners across parts of the American South and Midwest, and we’re willing to bet it’ll become a staple on your holiday table too.For ease, we call for a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix, which is available in most grocery stores and can also be bought online. Don’t be tempted to swap in plain cornmeal; Jiffy mix is a combination of cornmeal, all-purpose flour, sugar, and leaveners. An equal amount of a similar prepared cornbread mix should work just fine. We call for drained canned sweet corn, but frozen corn will work (you’ll need about 1½ cups; no need to thaw it first). A bit of sour cream adds bright balance, while a high ratio of eggs gives it setting power and helps it develop a gorgeous golden-brown color. To serve, top the corn pudding simply with chives or go all out and add a pat of butter and a drizzle of honey to boot. For a spicier, less bready take, try this cheesy corn casserole recipe with jalapeños and fresh herbs, or for a creamy corn recipe that uses fresh corn, creamed corn with tarragon is the move.",

    "title": "Mulled Wine",
    "description": "This heady mulled wine recipe is festive enough for Christmas or other holiday parties, but easy enough to make on any cold night when you crave a little cozy comfort. While mulled wine, sometimes called gluhwein or spiced wine, is one way to use up subpar bottles, remember that bad wine is never going to be great, no matter what you do to it. Still, you don’t need to splurge on expensive bottles of wine here. We recommend a Merlot for its softness and fruit-forward flavors, but pretty much any decent dry red wine will do. Look for Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah, Grenache, or ask your wine clerk for a recommendation. Use the same varietal for both bottles and leave the white wine for another day (may we recommend this strawberry sangria once the weather turns warm?).As for the other ingredients, look for fresh apple cider in the refrigerated section of your market or at a local apple orchard. Shelf-stable bottles will work in a pinch, but their flavor can’t compare. Next, while many recipes call for brown sugar or other sweeteners like maple syrup, we chose to finish the drink with a glug of sweet port wine instead, adding a deep, complex flavor. Finally, you should feel free to play with the spicing: Don’t like cloves? Leave them out. Add a couple of whole star anise pods or ½ tsp. of black peppercorns or allspice if you’d like. And if you only have big oranges, round orange slices are fine; just trim away the bulky white pith from the stem end and remove any seeds.Be sure not to let the mixture boil; the barest of simmers will coax plenty of flavor from the warm spices without cooking off all the alcohol. While it doesn’t require much prep time, this mulled wine recipe can be made two hours before serving. Reheat it gently over medium-low heat on a stovetop, and if you want to put it out for guests to serve themselves during a holiday party, keep it in a slow cooker set to low and leave a ladle nearby.",

Here we use cornmeal (make sure it is finely ground—this is no job for polenta) to play sensory tricks, giving these wedges a pervasive crunch.

    "title": "BA’s Best Chocolate Chip Cookies",
    "description": "Food director Chris Morocco spent months (truly) developing this chocolate chip cookie recipe—he made nearly 30 batches, plus 10 more in the cross-testing phase—to ensure they were the absolute best. What makes this recipe deliver on that promise? Crispy edges, a buttery chew, and plenty of chocolate chunks in every bite—all without a stand mixer.The cookies are rooted in classic Toll House flavor, but browning the butter amps up the toasty notes and is key in developing the balance of crisp edges, while a high ratio of brown sugar to white sugar ensures chewy chocolate chip cookie centers. The amount of flour and the quality of the pure vanilla extract is important here; Chris recommends Heilala or Nielsen-Massey, which have enough heft to stand up to bitter dark chocolate. We highly recommend weighing your flour with a scale; if you don’t have one, use a spoon to scoop the flour into a measuring cup until overflowing, and a straight edge (such as the back of a butter knife) to level it off.We understand cookie preferences aren’t uniform—some prefer soft cookies or a chewier finish. Others require a sprinkling of flaky sea salt on top. If your perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe includes nutty, crunchy bits, try our Anytime Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookie recipe. Heightened caramelly crunch? Head off to these Brown-Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies With Toffee. If you’re gluten-free (and even if not), try this version with milk, dark, and white chocolate.

    "title": "Hot Spiced Apple Cider",
    "description": "Picture it: peak fall. You’re enjoying apples every way you possibly can: as apple butter on toast, peanut butter scooped with apple slices for a midday snack, a piece of classic American apple pie at dessert. And at night, when the winds blow, you warm yourself by making this hot apple cider recipe, which doubles as aromatherapy. To intensify the flavor of fresh apple cider, Sean Rembold of Ingas Bar in Brooklyn recommends reducing store-bought cider on the stovetop. Doing so concentrates the cider’s sweetness, meaning there’s no need for maple syrup or brown sugar, which could mask the fruity apple flavor. His easy recipe includes a handful of mulling spices and a whole vanilla bean; warmed slowly in the cider, they infuse into the drink and perfume the air (fair warning: it’ll make your house smell incredible). If you’d rather skip the pricey vanilla bean, swap in 1 Tbsp. of vanilla extract, but add it after straining the mulled cider.When ready to serve, pour the hot cider through a fine mesh strainer, then divide among mugs. The nonalcoholic cider is lovely, but feel free to pour in a tipple for a little extra warmth. Garnish with an orange slice, a few cranberries, a star anise pod, or a fresh cinnamon stick. Or, if you’re serving this at a party, keep the strained cider warm in a slow cooker turned to its lowest setting (make it a warm-drinks buffet with a crock of hot chocolate too) and set out mugs and garnishes for guests.",

Reduce to medium-low heat and cook just below a simmer until flavors meld and cider has reduced slightly, about 1 hour.",

    "title": "Leveled-Up Potato Leek Soup",
    "description": "Contributor Christian Reynoso learned the hard way that using a blender to make creamy potato-leek soup can be a bit of a gamble. The purée easily goes gummy—and even if it doesn’t, the results are less dynamic and interesting to eat than a soup with creamy chunks of potato and caramelized pops of leek. This version of the classic pairing forgoes blending entirely, resulting in an easy potato soup with lots of texture and minimal cleanup.Choose small waxy potatoes like fingerlings or Yukon Golds over starchier Idaho or russet potatoes (don’t worry about peeling them unless you really want to). And try to find smaller-sized leeks that’ll match the potatoes’ circumference and fit easily into your soup spoon when sliced into rounds. The green parts of the leeks are too tough to eat, so trim them and reserve to make a batch of homemade vegetable broth.The bulk of this recipe’s prep time is spent on the gremolata topping—but it’s optional, so feel free to skip it and garnish the bowls with a simple snipping of fresh chives instead. Here’s where we try to convince you to go for the whole shebang: The combination of crispy fried sage, rosemary, thyme, and capers tossed with minced garlic and lemon zest adds a bright, aromatic punch to the warm potato-leek soup. It’s a delicate finish to the hearty, warm bowls, making this soup not just comforting, but also enlivening. And bonus, the recipe yields more topping than you’ll need. Mix any remaining gremolata with sour cream to make a ranch-style dip, use it in place of croutons as a crispy salad topper, or sprinkle it on braised chicken, seared salmon, fried eggs, or popcorn. Store the gremolata in an airtight container lined with paper towels with the lid slightly ajar (airflow will help it stay crisp); gently reheat in a dry skillet on the stovetop. Still craving a blended soup? Our Perfectly Creamy Potato Soup gets the immersion blender treatment for a bowl that’s less baby food, more perfect purée.",

Remove from heat and strain through prepared sieve. Let oil cool. You should have 2–3 Tbsp.; if you have more than that, pour off excess and reserve for another use (like frying toast or making a vinaigrette). Transfer capers to baking sheet with herbs.",

    "title": "Shabu-Shabu Noodle Soup",
    "description": "Shabu-shabu is a popular Japanese-style hot pot dish, influenced by Chinese hot pot, featuring loads of fresh vegetables, thinly sliced beef, and assorted sauces. “Shabu-shabu” is an onomatopoeic reference to the swish-swish sound of the meat as it gets dipped (and quickly cooked) in the seasoned broth. Shabu-shabu is also very popular in Korea, where you will find similarities and differences in both broth and dipping sauces.One of my favorite places to enjoy shabu-shabu in Korea is at the food-filled basement of Lotte Department Store in Seoul’s Myeong-dong area. Like many department store lower levels, there is no shortage of delights, offered as grocery, food court, and restaurant experiences. Shabujin, the shabu-shabu counter that often has lines, features individual pots in front of each customer, to allow for ultimate customization. You get a heap of vegetables as a base, and you can also add in specialty items like thinly sliced kabocha squash, king mushrooms, and (my favorite) fresh wheat noodles to help finish off the shabu-shabu experience.In this recipe, I turn shabu-shabu into a one-pot beef noodle soup, which comes together quickly for a weeknight dinner crowd. Instant dashi is one of the stars of the show, anchoring the broth with the distinct shabu-shabu broth flavor. Cabbage and shiitake mushrooms also contribute to the soup’s flavor, adding both sweetness and umami, respectively. Pre-shaved beef, often employed in dishes like Philly cheese steak, is another favorite ingredient of mine; and here, just a bit brings deep flavor to an otherwise delicately seasoned broth. The key here is to keep the shaved beef cold in the fridge until just before using (yes, I realize this goes against everything we tell you about bringing your meat to room temp!). Otherwise, it’s harder to separate the “leaves” of beef from each other. If you can’t get your hands on shaved beef, freeze a piece of sirloin or similar cut for about an hour or more to make knife work easier.Shabu-shabu is a layered flavor experience, and here I mimic that in making sure the longer-to-cook items like cabbage go in first. Don’t forget to skim any scum that might arise from the meat with a skimmer for the cleanest-tasting broth. Fresh noodles also take no time to cook, so don’t be tempted to walk away! The noodles’ starch helps give the ensuing broth great body. I forgo external dipping sauces, instead adding soy sauce to the broth itself and serving with lemon wedges to mimic a fresh ponzu-style brightness at the end.",

    "title": "Extremely Cheesy Corn Casserole",
    "description": "The perfect side dish for Thanksgiving is not a classic green bean casserole, nor is it a crock of ultra-creamy mashed potatoes. For me, Thanksgiving’s not Thanksgiving without this cheesy corn casserole recipe. Is it fancy? Nope. Is it comfort food you’ll want to reheat the next day and eat straight from the Pyrex? Absolutely. And it doesn’t require much prep time—or a box of regionally available cornbread mix—to put together.Dubbed “that creamy, cheesy corn thing” by those in the know, this easy recipe starts with canned corn, making it decidedly simple to put together (you don’t even need a mixing bowl). Avoid cans labeled “creamed corn” or “cream-style corn”—you’re looking for plain canned sweet corn kernels. Heated with cream cheese, cheddar, and Parmesan (plus diced green chiles and garlic), the kernels add sweetness and pops of texture to the creamy, melty dish. You can assemble the corn casserole a few days ahead; top it with the breadcrumbs and more cheese before popping it in the oven for 15 minutes to warm up—just enough time to carve the turkey. It’s so make-ahead friendly, in fact, you can cook it all the way through and cart it along to a potluck since it’s even great at room temperature.My “creamy, cheesy corn thing” isn’t the only corn casserole out there. If you’re in it for the version on the back of a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix, which one BA staffer thought was a treasured family secret, we’ve got the deets on that too. (Spoiler alert: Hers has a ton of extra melted butter.) We also have a hominy-bolstered corn pudding enriched with sour cream and laced with poblano chiles and Cotija cheese, and a creamed corn soufflé made with grated ears of fresh corn.

    "title": "Lemon Meringue Pie",
    "description": "Developed to rival Thanksgiving turkey as Star for the Day, our best lemon meringue pie recipe is a showstopper any time of year. The towering concoction is impressive but not austere. Familiar yet refreshing—and you get to set the whole thing on fire (almost).It starts with an exceptionally flaky pie crust, which comes from the technique of quartering your assembled pie dough and stacking the quadrants before rolling them out (a kind of low-key lamination). Note: This recipe makes enough pie dough for two single-crust pies. You can reduce the amounts by half, but why not make the second disk and pop it into the freezer? It will hold for up to 3 months; use it to make another dessert (say, chocolate pudding pie) down the line.For bold flavor, the pie filling gets the zest of 4 whole lemons. If you don’t have a rasp-style grater (or yours is dull), this is a good time to buy one. Otherwise, peel the yellow skin of the lemon, avoiding the bitter white pith, with a vegetable peeler, then place the strips of lemon zest in a blender or food processor with the water listed in the directions, and blitz until puréed before whisking it into the egg and cornstarch mixture.You can easily break up the work over a few days if you’d like. The lemon curd filling will need to chill in the prebaked pie shell for at least 2 hours before serving, but it will hold for up to 3 days. The egg whites will also be fine in the fridge for a few days; wait until you’re ready to serve to make the meringue topping. When medium-stiff peaks form, transfer the fluffy garnish to a piping bag for the dotted look pictured, or just pile and swirl it on top of the pie and singe it to finish. While a broiler will work, this recipe is an excellent excuse to buy a kitchen torch.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 Tbsp. sugar",
      "2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "2⅔ cups (333 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting",
      "1½ cups (3 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into ½\" pieces",
      "1 cup (200 g) sugar",
      "⅓ cup cornstarch",
      "2 large eggs",
      "4 large egg yolks",
      "1 Finely grated zest of 4 lemons",

      "3 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "4 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter",
      "¾ large egg whites, room temperature",
      "½ cup (150 g) sugar",
      "¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt"

    "steps": [
      "Whisk 2 Tbsp. sugar, 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, and 2⅔ cups (333 g) all-purpose flour in a medium bowl. Add 1½ cups (3 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into ½\" pieces, and, using your fingers, smash each piece into a thin disk. Take your time doing this and don’t feel compelled to break butter into even smaller pieces. Drizzle ⅔ cup ice-cold water over, dispersing it as widely as possible, and mix with a rubber spatula to bring mixture together into a shaggy mass.",
      "Turn dough out onto a surface and work together with your hands, pushing and flattening until dough holds together when squeezed in your palm but some streaks of dry flour are still visible. Divide dough into 2 portions.",
      "Flatten 1 portion of dough into an 8\"-diameter disk. Cut into quarters, stack pieces on top of one another, and flatten dough with a rolling pin to about half of its original height. At this point dough should hold together with no dry spots remaining, and have nice big flakes of butter showing. Use a bench scraper or a large knife to clean any clingy bits of dough from surface. Dust surface with flour, then dust top of dough with flour. Roll out to a ¼\"–⅜\"-thick round. Wrap dough around rolling pin and transfer to a standard 9\"-diameter pie plate. Unfurl into dish, then lift edges and allow dough to slump down into dish. Trim overhang to an even 1\" (there will be some excess). Fold overhang under and crimp as desired. Cover and chill until very cold, at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours (cover tightly in plastic wrap if chilling longer than 1 hour). Repeat process with remaining dough and another pie plate. Or form into a 1½\"-thick disk, wrap in plastic, and chill up to 3 days (or freeze up to 1 month).",
      "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat oven to 400°. Lay 2 sheets of parchment paper over dough and fill with pie weights or dried beans (they should fill the dish). Set on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet (this will keep any butter drips from smoking up your oven). Bake until edges are lightly golden and bottom is opaque (carefully lift parchment to check; when ready, the crust will not stick to parchment), 30–35 minutes. Remove from oven; reduce oven temperature to 300°. Lift out parchment and weights. Bake crust until evenly deep golden brown all over, 10–15 minutes. If baking both crusts, turn oven dial back up to 400° and let oven preheat; repeat with remaining crust.",
      "Whisk 1 cup (200 g) sugar and ⅓ cup cornstarch in a medium saucepan to combine. Add 2 large eggs and 4 large egg yolks to sugar mixture and whisk vigorously, making sure to get into corners of pan, until mixture is smooth and pale. Whisk in the finely grated zest of 4 lemons, 1 cup fresh lemon juice, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and 1½ cups water.",
      "Place saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer, whisking often and making sure to get into corners of pan, 8–10 minutes (mixture should be bubbling and thickened). Reduce heat and continue to simmer, whisking constantly, 3 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, whisking every minute.",
      "Add 3 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter to lemon filling and whisk until melted and fully incorporated. Scrape hot filling into baked pie crust; smooth surface. Chill until cold and set, at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.",

Morton kosher salt, and ¼ tsp. cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer or another heatproof large bowl; set over a large saucepan filled with 1\" simmering water (bowl shouldn’t touch the water). Heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved and mixture is warm to the touch, about 4 minutes.",
      "Fit bowl onto mixer fitted with whisk attachment (or use an electric mixer) and beat on medium-high speed until meringue is more than tripled in volume and medium peaks form, about 4 minutes.

    "title": "Chocolate Pie With Press-In Crust",
    "description": "There may never be a dessert so inviting as a chocolate pudding pie. This version, from chef Elizabeth Falkner, is intensely chocolaty, comes with a cloud of whipped cream, and sports a press-in crust so easy you could assemble it with your eyes closed. Faulkner gilds her chocolate pie recipe with an optional cacao nib praline (that, shh, is also extremely easy to make) for a garnish that’ll make your homemade pie look like you got dessert catered from a swanky restaurant.Since the creamy chocolate pie filling will never see the glow of the oven, you’ll have to blind-bake the pie shell until it’s golden brown. We like a metal pie plate for its superior ability to conduct heat. You don’t actually need pie weights for this pie crust recipe, but if you want extra insurance that the dough won’t slump, the best pie weights are also made from metal.The pie filling gets its rich chocolate flavor from unsweetened cocoa powder and good-quality semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips, disks, or chopped bars. Remember to temper the egg yolks so they don’t curdle by slowly pouring the hot milk mixture while whisking (enlist a friend to hold the bowl in place if you’re having trouble).We love the juxtaposition of dense chocolate pudding and fluffy whipped cream, but you will have some leftover egg whites; if you prefer a stiff-peaked meringue topping, by all means switch it up (follow the directions in our Lemon Meringue Pie recipe). And about that praline: If you’d rather skip it, top the pie with simple chocolate shavings, crushed chocolate cookies, or absolutely nothing at all.",
    "ingredients": [

    "title": "BA’s Best Mac and Cheese",
    "description": "This baked mac and cheese recipe is our Platonic ideal of the comfort food classic: It is creamy and deeply cheesy, has a crunchy crust, and is impressive enough to serve at a dinner party. (Yes, macaroni and cheese is appropriate dinner party fare, and yes, this recipe can be doubled if you expect an extra-large crowd.) It’s also bound to make an annual appearance on your buffet of Thanksgiving side dishes.Béchamel, a roux enriched with whole milk, keeps the sauce in our homemade mac and cheese creamy and shouldn’t be rushed. Allow a minute for the raw flour taste to cook off before adding the warm milk gradually. Don’t be alarmed if the sauce looks thin at first; it will continue to thicken as it bakes with the noodles. A word on those noodles: While elbow macaroni or any short pasta will work, we recommend something with ridges, such as cavatappi, which will grip nicely onto the sauce.Deploying four different shredded cheeses may seem excessive, but each plays its part in the recipe: Gruyère gives the sauce a nutty richness, while sharp cheddar cheese brings tang, and fontina ensures it’s lush and creamy. Meanwhile, Parmesan cheese adds a salty, savory hit to the crispy panko topping. A touch of cayenne and English mustard powder adds kick to the whole affair (if you don’t have them, a few dashes of hot sauce and a squirt of Dijon will do).Looking for Stovetop Mac ‘n’ Cheese made extra lush with a pour of heavy cream?

      "Preheat oven to 350°. Melt 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add ¾ cup panko and cook, stirring, until crumbs are golden brown, 6–8 minutes (make sure to get them toasty brown; they won’t darken much during baking). Transfer to a small bowl and toss with ¼ oz.

      "Bring béchamel sauce to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, stirring, until sauce is thickened and doesn’t feel grainy when a little bit is rubbed between your fingers, 6–8 minutes (cooking the flour thoroughly at this stage ensures a creamy sauce).

    "title": "Easy Roasted Carrots With Thyme",
    "description": "This recipe for roasted carrots is incredibly simple, and the cook time is just long enough for you to make a complete dinner while the veggies are in the oven. Start with whole carrots—never “baby carrots.” If you spot multicolored varieties at the farmers market in the fall or spring, grab them for a fun addition to your weeknight dinner. If they’re young and you don’t mind the carrot skins, you can skip peeling, but for a more elegant meal, grab that vegetable peeler and get to work.It doesn’t really matter how you cut the carrots, as long as they’re evenly sized. Toss the cut carrots onto an unlined sheet pan—a barrier of parchment paper would slow their browning and rob you of the crispy edges and concentrated natural sweetness that comes from direct veg-on-metal action. Roasting the carrots in a hot oven will ensure they get nicely caramelized, but remember to stir them periodically as they roast to prevent burning. (This method also works well for other roasted veggies like brussels sprouts, parsnips, and sweet potatoes.)This easy recipe takes well to all kinds of variation: Add some ground cumin or garlic powder (about 1 tsp. each) or a pinch of brown sugar before they go into the oven; then squeeze some fresh lemon juice or sprinkle some zest over the top when they’re out. Spoon the roasted carrots over a dish of whipped yogurt and garnish them with fresh herbs like more thyme (or switch it up with parsley, dill, or cilantro) and an extra drizzle of olive oil.If you prefer something sweeter, try glazed carrots with maple syrup or chicken with honey-roasted carrots.",

    "title": "Hadji Bada (Iraqi Almond Cookies)",
    "description": "These flourless almond cookies are “sort of like French macarons,” explains cookbook author Jake Cohen, but “without the meringue, and much easier to throw together any time you want.” He learned the recipe from his great-aunt-in-law, Doris, who handed him a copy at his family’s first blended Passover seder and notes that “it’s the gift that keeps on giving.”The chewy, crispy-shelled, melt-in-your-mouth cookies have a pronounced almond flavor without necessitating the use of sometimes-cloying almond extract. They require next to no prep time, and since the recipe is made without butter or all-purpose flour, it’s naturally dairy- and gluten-free.Be sure to buy finely ground almond flour, not coarser almond meal. The other “secret ingredient” here is rose water, which gives these cookies a delicate floral undertone that sets off the nuttiness of the almonds. These are the best cookies to make in a sparse kitchen, since they don’t require special equipment. The wet and dry ingredients come together with a mixing bowl and whisk, and their striking appearance is all done by hand—no cookie scoops or stand mixers allowed. To do it, you’ll wet your hands in a bowl of water, lightly scented with a few drops more rose water. Having damp hands will enable you to handle the sticky cookie dough and shape it into spheres without making a mess.Bake them until the edges are barely golden brown, and let them cool on the baking sheet instead of transferring them to a wire rack. Store leftovers at room temperature in an airtight container.For almond cookies with a more Italian-American vibe, try these ones made with cocoa and coffee. They’re finished with powdered sugar and are perfect for a Christmas cookie tin.This recipe was excerpted from ‘Jew-ish’ by Jake Cohen. Buy the full book on Amazon.",

    "title": "Cheesy Sausage Breakfast Casserole",
    "description": "This easy breakfast casserole recipe is a wonderful move for Christmas morning or Easter brunch, but you don’t need to save it for a holiday. It’s easy to throw together on a weekend and averages just a couple of dollars per serving, making it great for any group. Consider the recipe below a formula rather than a strict guide, with the building blocks of creamy eggs, sliced bread, shredded cheese, and plenty of add-ins.This egg casserole takes an Italian-American angle with spicy pork sausage, piquant Romano cheese, and melty Fontina cheese (plus blistered bell peppers). But you can easily swap these out for whatever you’ve got on hand. Think sagy breakfast sausage with caramelized onions, and pepper Jack or sharp cheddar cheese, or leftover diced grilled chicken with Swiss cheese and mushrooms. You can also swap out the country bread for any gluten-free loaf (or frozen hash browns) to accommodate dietary needs.If it’s a make-ahead breakfast casserole you’re after, this strata can be assembled up to 2 days in advance. Working last minute? That’s fine, too, but don’t rush the 20-minute soaking time, necessary for letting the bread absorb the custard. While it’s in the oven, make a batch of crispy skillet hash browns and a fresh fruit salad to serve alongside. Wrap leftovers tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate. You can reheat them the next morning or enjoy them at room temperature.Looking for more Christmas morning breakfast ideas? Our collection includes cinnamon rolls, French toast casserole, and more.",

    "title": "Pasta e Fagiolini",
    "description": "A summer green bean is undoubtedly a thing of beauty, but it’s also short-lived. For those late-season or out-of-season green beans, forget blanching and slow-cook them into oblivion instead. Admittedly, the drab olive exterior is unfortunate, but don’t let looks fool you: The end result is disproportionately good—a silky bean with concentrated sweetness, no matter how tough or stringy it started out. The acidic tomatoes help the green beans retain their structure through the long cook, and a modest amount of lemon and cheese sharpen everything at the end. Think of this Italian classic as the summer counterpart to pasta e fagioli, the hearty soup featuring pasta and beans (often cannellini). It’s a hearty, vegetarian-friendly dish that’s easy on your wallet thanks to its reliance on a mix of seasonal produce and pantry staples. And if rent is due and the paycheck hasn’t cleared, make it with frozen green beans for an even more economical version.

    "title": "Cinnamon Apple Crumb Pie",
    "description": "This festive apple crumb pie recipe has a flaky bottom crust, tightly packed layers of cinnamon-spiced apples, and a golden brown crumble topping that looks impressive but is lightyears easier to make than fiddling with a complicated lattice. Letting the homemade pie dough rest before rolling it out is vital since it ensures even hydration. Allowing it to rest again after fitting it into the pie plate lets the glutens to relax, preventing the pie crust from shrinking while it bakes. Keeping the dough chilled at both stages makes handling easier and practically guarantees flaky layers.For this recipe, as for our double-crusted deep-dish apple pie, we like using sliced apples in the filling—not chunks or wedges. (If apple cubes are more your vibe, go with our Dutch Apple Pie instead.) Slices melt into each other as they bake, leaving less room for air pockets to develop, which may cause gaps. A mandoline can help. The recipe calls for Granny Smiths, but any tart apple will work (check out our guide to the best apples for making pie).We’ve kept the crumble topping nut-free, but if you want an extra-crunchy apple pie, toss in a handful of chopped walnuts or pecans (no need to toast them first; they’ll get enough color as the pie bakes). If you notice the top of the pie browning too quickly, loosely tent the pie plate with aluminum foil to finish baking.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Pumpkin Pie",
    "description": "The best pumpkin pie recipe needs to do three things to succeed. It must have a perfectly spiced creamy filling. A crust that’s flaky yet tender. And, perhaps most importantly, it should seriously tempt anyone choosing from a vast and competitive Thanksgiving dessert spread (we see you pecan tart). This recipe delivers on all fronts and then some. One commenter even declared, “I don’t think there [are] enough words in the English vocabulary to describe just how wonderful this homemade pumpkin pie is.” If you’re new to pie baking, check out this guide to blind-baking homemade pie crust. You can use these tips for a store-bought pie shell or frozen pie crust too, but note that premade crusts tend to bake more quickly, so check them about 5 minutes early. Don’t worry too much about your crimping style; while a classic pinch looks nice, a simpler fork crimp works just as well. Sweetened condensed milk adds decadence to the custard, while using individual spices (instead of a premixed “pumpkin spice” blend) lets you adjust the ratio to suit your tastes. The combination here is subtle and warming, built to highlight the flavors of the canned pumpkin (we like Libby’s). To ensure the filling stays creamy, remove the pie pan from the oven when the custard is still jiggly in the center; it will set as the pie cools. And if any cracks form, hide the fissures with a garnish of freshly whipped cream. ",

    "title": "BA’s Best Pecan Pie",
    "description": "This classic pecan pie recipe has no chocolate chips, booze, or hard-to-find ingredients. Instead of focusing on embellishments, we homed in on the things that really matter: the deep flavor of toasted pecans, a caramely custard, and buttery flaky pie crust.The pie dough is simple, but be sure not to overwork it, and keep in mind that the crust is blind-baked, meaning the pie shell is popped into the oven twice—once before the filling is added and then again after. Corn syrup is essential to pecan pie filling, giving it its signature gooey texture. It’s gotten a bad rap over the past few years, but we wouldn’t bake without it—if you can’t or don’t want to use it, brown rice syrup makes a noble substitute. Finally, we love the crunch you get from pecan halves, but if you’re a chopped pecan person, feel free to swap them in (you’ll need about 225 g).Serve your pecan pie all on its own, or gild it with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. For a full Thanksgiving dessert spread, slip another pie or two alongside (like BA’s Best Apple Pie). Finally, don’t forget to have aluminum foil on hand so you can send a few slices home with your guests for breakfast the following day.Like many other Thanksgiving staples, homemade pecan pie requires some planning. If you have time in the days or weeks before serving, consider making the simple pie crust recipe ahead; the dough can be stored in the freezer for up to two months. If you’re hosting (and even if you’re not), feel free to bake the pie the day before—your guests will be just as impressed. If you’re a big planner, you can freeze the baked pie (follow the same tips in our guide to freezing pumpkin pie; the frozen pie will last three months.)Want to change it up this year?

    "title": "Bolo Bao (Pineapple Buns)",
    "description": "Named for their crispy topping that looks like the exterior of a pineapple, bolo bao (“pineapple buns” in Cantonese) are a popular Hong Kong baked good, but they can be found at Chinese bakeries across the globe.This version uses a simple milk bread recipe that’s easier than most as it does not require a tangzhong (a cooked paste of flour and milk or water, typically responsible for the bread’s plush texture). It also uses instant, not active-dry yeast, and all-purpose instead of bread flour, which makes the dough extra tender. Since all-purpose flour has a lower protein content, you’ll want to knead the bread dough for at least 5–7 minutes to develop sufficient gluten. Determine whether the dough is ready by way of the windowpane test: Stretch a small piece of dough with your hands until you can see light filtering through—and without tearing a hole in the dough. Let the dough proof, then divide it into equal portions and, on a clean work surface, roll it into tight balls.The textural topping in this pineapple bun recipe is made using a similar technique to choux au craquelin, where a round similar to sugar cookie dough is placed on top of a shaped dough ball just before baking. The topping adheres to the bun, turning crackly-crunchy as it bakes.At cha chaan teng, or Hong Kong–style diners, bolo bao are often served stuffed with a thick slab of butter, which chef Laurence Louie upholds at Rubato, his Hong Kong–style cafe in Quincy, MA—one of our Best New Restaurants of 2023.

    "description": "A quintessential cha chaan teng (Hong Kong–style diner) dish, baked pork chop rice is comfort food at its finest. Simple fried rice, flavorfully marinated pork chops, and a soy-sauce-and-ketchup–spiked tomato sauce are layered under a blanket of burnished melted cheese. This recipe comes from chef Laurence Louie of Rubato, a Hong Kong–style café in Quincy, MA—one of our Best New Restaurants of 2023. Where the restaurant serves individual plated portions, this recipe is scaled up to bake in a casserole dish and be served family-style.Louie’s pork chop rice calls for boneless pork chops that you’ll slice into strips before velveting, a technique that keeps meat succulent and tender. Adding baking soda to the pork’s marinade and mixing it vigorously creates an external coating that browns well while retaining the juiciness of the meat inside.",

It’s a deliberate choice that increases the ratio of meat to breading while showcasing good locally sourced pork. Chilling the generously seasoned chops for an extended period of time allows the meat to slowly dry-brine within its panko shell, better regulating how it cooks. The breading is such an effective insulator, it’s imperative to remove the chops far ahead of being done, allowing for residual heat to do the rest of the cooking.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Tuna Casserole",
    "description": "Full disclosure: This is not the easiest tuna noodle casserole recipe out there. And that’s because we nixed canned soup in favor of a homemade take on cream of mushroom soup that’s enriched not with whole milk, but with heavy cream—we promise the minimal extra effort is worth it. There’s no canned tuna, either. Instead, we call for jars of olive-oil-packed tuna, which ensures the fish stays moist and tender while the casserole is baked in the oven. Mushy macaroni? That’s gone, too, in favor of perfectly cooked egg noodles. All in all, it’s a major upgrade while remaining squarely in the realm of comfort food.Texture is king in a tuna casserole. So, don’t follow the pasta’s package directions. Undercooking the noodles ensures the final dish will still retain some bite. As they cool, you’ll sauté diced vegetables in melted butter and make a quick roux to serve as the base for the creamy sauce that holds everything together. For the topping, we nixed ho-hum breadcrumbs for salty, crispy potato chips. But these are not crushed potato chips; instead, we tuck whole chips upright into the mix to give this family favorite a wonderfully crunchy element that turns golden brown, not soggy-sad.With a prep time of about 45 minutes, this hearty main dish is an ambitious but achievable weeknight dinner, but it’s also a great thing to make on Sunday night so you can enjoy leftovers in the coming days.

    "title": "Slow Roast Beef",
    "description": "This roast beef recipe has devoted fans. One commenter proclaims: “I’m pretty shy about leaving reviews, but I knew I had to say something about this recipe…. [It’s] probably the best thing I have ever made.” Case closed.Just kidding, we do have a few more thoughts: While you can make a tender roast beef with myriad cuts of meat (like top round roast, bottom round roast, rump roast, chuck roast…the list goes on), here we call for a strip roast. This boneless cut is to NY strip what prime rib roast is to a rib-eye steak. Strip roasts have the advantage of being slightly more compact with greater surface area. That means you get a better ratio of outer crust to inner meat—and, frankly, they’re a lot more manageable for a home kitchen.Seasoning is crucial when dealing with a large cut of beef, so plan ahead. You’ll want to salt and pepper the roast and rub it with the rosemary-garlic oil, at least 12 hours before you plan to start cooking. The seasoned roast can rest in the fridge for up to 2 days; the longer you let it go, the better. This recipe uses a reverse-searing technique: First, you’ll cook the meat in the oven. Setting it on a wire rack, instead of inside a deep roasting pan, allows the heat to circulate more evenly. Meanwhile, using a meat thermometer ensures perfect roast beef, cooked to your ideal level of doneness, despite the long cook time. After it rests you’ll sear the roast on the stovetop in a heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven to develop that mouthwatering crust. We like this roast served in thin slices for tucking into buttery Parker House rolls with bright cornichons and creamy-kicky horseradish sauce—essentially teeny special-occasion roast beef sandwiches. But you can also use the pan drippings and some beef broth to make gravy if you’d prefer; just don’t forget a side dish like mashed potatoes or Yorkshire pudding to go along with.Pro-tip: Leftover roast beef makes a killer French dip. Prefer a slow cooker pot roast? We’ve got you.",

Meaty fillets of cod (or other white fish) stand in for oysters, and a crisp topping of cured sausage blitzed with breadcrumbs, herbs, and lots of cheese recalls the same surf-and-turf vibe. Shop for a wide, flat fillet (rather than narrow and thick) to provide the most surface area for the topping to adhere.",

Instead, it relies on a few powerful pantry items: soy sauce, fish sauce, and ultra-savory Maggi Savor liquid seasoning. At Kuya Lord, Llera uses vermicelli noodles in his pancit sotanghon rather than glass noodles, and offers diners the option to add a luxe topping to the already fully loaded dish: lechon kawali (twice-cooked pork belly), prawns, or both.If you have a leftover cooked chicken breast from another recipe sitting in your refrigerator, these noodles make a great place to use it up.

    "title": "Ice Cream Cake With So Many Sprinkles",
    "description": "Far too often summer birthdays fly under the radar, forgotten in the frenzy of beach vacations and park picnics. That’s why we created this ice cream birthday cake—to finally give all the Cancers, Leos, and Virgos their due. With two layers of confetti cake, vanilla and strawberry ice cream, whipped cream, and a showering of sprinkles, this dessert is the best way to celebrate someone’s special day. (If you think an ice cream cake should never include cake, check out this cookie-packed recipe, then read our editors’ heated debate.) This make-ahead ice cream cake requires a bit of time (the constructed cake needs to freeze overnight) but relatively little effort. The confetti cake recipe is adapted from our Easiest Vanilla Birthday Cake. Dividing the cake batter between two pans creates thin layers, ideal for stacking with ice cream. If you only have one cake pan, just bake the cake in a single layer; once it’s cooled, use a serrated knife to slice it in half horizontally (this technique is called torting). Baking the cake ahead of time and stashing it in the freezer makes the cake easier to build—the frozen layers won’t crumble or compress under the weight of the ice cream. And about the ice cream: This recipe calls for strawberry and vanilla, but feel free to swap out these flavors for your favorite pints. Cake batter or chocolate ice cream would be more than welcome here.A springform pan makes the unmolding process smooth as can be, but if you don’t have one, don’t fret: A regular 9\"-diameter cake pan will do. (Try to use one with a 3\" height—the tall sides give the layers structure in the freezer.) After unmolding the cake, you might notice that the plastic wrap has imprinted crinkles onto the sides. For the smoothest finish, use a hot offset spatula or bench scraper to smooth the sides of the cake, removing any excess ice cream in the process.The beauty of an ice cream cake is that it can be made ahead of time and stashed in the freezer. You can make the whipped cream just before serving or put the entire cake together and freeze up to a day before; the frozen whip gives the cake an ultra-nostalgic Carvel vibe. Finish with sprinkles, of course.",

      "Run an offset spatula or bench scraper under hot water and wipe dry. Holding perpendicular to cake and pressing lightly, run around side to smooth and peel away excess ice cream (the motion is similar to crumb-coating a cake with frosting). Rinse spatula with hot water and dry with a kitchen towel after each stroke. Move quickly at this stage—if you fuss with it too much, the cake will start to melt. Don’t worry about smoothing the top as it will be covered with whipped cream.",
      "Mound whipped cream on top of cake and spread to the edges with a spoon or clean rubber spatula, making decorative swoops and swirls. Top with sprinkles.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Shrimp Cocktail",
    "description": "Great shrimp cocktail recipes are all about the little things. Namely, guidance on the right shrimp for the job, how to cook them perfectly, and how best to achieve the classic balanced but zingy sauce. This one gets the details right. (Catch former BA staffer Molly Baz making shrimp cocktail here.)You’re looking for big, fat, just-cooked shrimp for this classic appetizer, so size and precision matter—the size will be printed on the bag of frozen shrimp at the grocery store, or ask your fishmonger about fresh, raw shrimp. We think 16–20 per pound is best for this recipe. (Otherwise, follow these guidelines: For 26–30, poach 1½ minutes; for 21–25, poach 2 minutes; for 13–15, poach 4 minutes; for 8–12, poach 5 minutes; read more in our guide to cooking shrimp.)No matter the size, shrimp cook best with their shells on. The shells flavor the cooking liquid and prevent the seafood from overcooking. As soon as the shrimp have turned opaque, get them into a cold water bath, fast; dropping ice into the cooking liquid makes that simple. (If your pot is too small, use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to a separate bowl filled with salted ice water.) Serve the chilled shrimp tail-on, scattered over more cracked ice, and garnish with lemon wedges alongside a cocktail sauce kissed with tomatoey chili sauce, which gives the dip more oomph than ketchup ever could.For a completely different feel, serve the poached shrimp with aioli or guacamole with lime juice, cilantro, and tortilla chips.

    "title": "Cookies and Cream Ice Cream Cake",
    "description": "If you love to pick the crunchy crumb topping off of baked goods, this ice cream cake is for you. One batch of crunchies—richly flavored with Dutch-process cocoa powder and espresso powder—is used three ways: pressed into a crust to add structure, folded into vanilla ice cream for a dreamy cookies-and-cream filling, and scattered across the cake as a Flintstones-like pebbly topper. Feel free to swap in another ice cream flavor if vanilla isn’t your speed; chocolate and coffee are obvious top contenders.To keep your fudge and ice cream layers crisp and distinct, don’t rush the freezing process. Giving each section enough time to set before adding the next layer ensures clean lines in the final slices. If you’re in a time crunch (or aesthetics are less important to you), you can get away with loading the pan up a little faster. The components might intermingle, but is anybody mad at a fudge ripple?Like most ice cream cakes, this treat needs a full night’s chill in the freezer to firm up completely before serving. Once you do bring it out to slice, keep an eye on it; as it’s almost entirely ice cream, the cake will lose its structure quickly. Pop it back into the freezer as needed to re-chill. For an ice cream cake with literal cake (of course our editors have a lot of thoughts on this), look no further than this sprinkles-laden recipe. ",

    "title": "A Better Turkey Chili",
    "description": "You deserve an upgrade from that vintage bottle of chili powder lurking in the back of your cabinet. Let this hearty turkey chili recipe guide you. To make it, you’ll blend a robust purée of dried chiles and canned chipotles to serve as the soup’s base. Building a custom chile blend allows you to create the chili of your dreams, which is to say: don’t worry too much if you can’t find the exact chiles we recommend. (And also, yes, chile and chili refer to different things.) Dark ancho chiles are smoky and have a raisiny sweetness; skinny, wrinkly pasillas a rich jamminess; and smooth-skinned guajillos bring bright red color and acidity. If you need to swap one out, aim for something around the same heat level (read more in our guide to chiles). Feel free to make a double batch and stick half in the freezer (for up to 6 months) to make satisfying your next weeknight chili craving even easier.We prefer dark meat turkey for its richer flavor and fat content, but if all you have in the fridge is lean ground turkey or ground chicken, it’ll work. Brown it in batches to get a really good sear—the crusty fond that forms on the bottom of the pot is big-time flavor. When you sauté the veg, use a wooden spoon to scrape up all those bits (the steam from the veggies will help release them) and stir them into the mix. We love the flavor a bottle of hard cider or beer adds to chili, but if you’d rather cook without alcohol, substitute fresh apple cider, a can of crushed tomatoes or tomato juice, or add a cup more water instead.We round out the soup with creamy white beans, but you probably already know any bean will do. Red kidney beans, pinto beans, and black beans are good substitutes. Like many comfort foods, chili is personal: put out bowls of shredded cheddar cheese, thinly sliced green onion, or pickled red onion, if you like. For an extra kick, grab the hot sauce or pickled jalapeños. Serve with broken tostadas or tortilla chips for scooping or cornbread for dunking.Looking for ground beef chili or chicken chili? We have you covered.",

    "title": "Old Bay Breakfast Potatoes",
    "description": "Who decided home fries had to be diced into bitsy squares? In this recipe for breakfast potatoes, the spuds are cut into bold wedges, unapologetic in their size and seasoning. Less knife work also means less prep time, making these entirely appropriate for a lazy brunch or an easy breakfast side dish. Buttering the baking sheet and coating the potatoes in vegetable oil (rather than olive oil, which could burn at such high temperatures) ensures deeply browned spuds, crispy outside and fluffy within. For the best breakfast potatoes, use Yukon Golds. Russet potatoes bake up crunchy but pale, while red potatoes get too dark while remaining soft. Old Bay seasoning, with its distinctive blend of paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper—among other spices—is the quickest route to bold flavor.Stuff these breakfast potatoes into a breakfast burrito with a tofu scramble and roasted red bell peppers, or serve them simply, in a large bowl with a fried egg and a scattering of fresh herbs, and a side of ketchup.Looking for a different kind of breakfast potato?

The dough for these oatmeal chocolate chip cookies is optimized for being portioned and frozen so that you can grab one or two (or 10) dough balls at a time and bake them straight from the freezer. Imbued with maximum texture and flavor from oats, whole grain flour, and nuts and seeds, these are perfect cookies. Trust us.A few baking tips to remember: Toasting the nuts, seeds, and coconut will bring out each ingredient’s flavor. For the chocolate, disks, chips, or chocolate chunks all work, but semisweet or bittersweet dark chocolate is what you’re after, not milk chocolate chips. And go for old-fashioned rolled oats, not quick-cooking oats, which can make the cookies dry and cakey instead of chewy.A cookie scoop will make portioning these large cookies much easier, but a ¼ cup measure also works. Once baked, cool them on the cookie sheet (for however long you’re able to keep your composure), not a wire rack, to help maintain their crispy bottoms.If you’re more into the classics, these oatmeal-raisin cookies are among our favorite cookie recipes.

    "title": "Aromatic Rice Pilaf",
    "description": "If you often find yourself in a rut of steaming plain white rice to complement your weeknight dinners, this fragrant rice pilaf recipe is an easy upgrade. Toasting a warming mixture of spices—cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves—in butter awakens a range of flavors you wouldn’t get without blooming them first. (The spice mix is inspired by garam masala, a classic Indian blend that straddles the line between sweet and savory.) After toasting the spices, you’ll sauté the rice to coat each grain with the spiced butter before adding water and simmering on the stovetop. This does two things for the rice: It adds flavor by caramelizing the starches in the grains. And, since you’re using fat (i.e., butter, but this goes for olive oil too), the rice will steam into individual, scoopable grains instead of a sticky mass. You can use white basmati rice instead of the jasmine called for here, or any variety of long-grain rice you have on hand.This seasoned rice dish can be a delicious meal all on its own, topped with a fried or poached egg or bulked up with various sweet and savory add-ins like tart dried apricots or cherries; silky roasted bell peppers; or crunchy pine nuts, pistachios, or almonds. It’s also a perfect side dish for a vegetable-forward dinner and makes a great base for slow-roasted salmon or any grilled fish.Rice pilaf is as delicious cold as it is warm; if you’d like to make a big batch to divvy throughout the week, leave out the herbs and store in an airtight container. To reheat, microwave the pilaf in bursts or cook it crispy-rice style, and add the herbs just before serving.",

    "title": "Smoky Sweet Corn Ribs",
    "description": "With their curved shape and handheld size, corn ribs are just as much fun to eat as their meaty counterpart. The fresh corn preparation went viral on TikTok in 2021, but restaurants like Momofuku Ssäm Bar were preparing this vegetarian side dish well before that. The good news is that you need little more than a very sharp knife to turn a humble ear of corn into a crispy-kerneled appetizer for your next backyard BBQ.Some corn ribs recipes use a grill or air fryer; this version opts for the oven. While some grocery stores have started selling pre-cut corn ribs, the dish is better with freshly shucked summer corn. But even with the best knife skills, slicing a whole corn cob lengthwise can be daunting (not to mention dangerous). Instead, halve the cobs crosswise, then slice into stout quarters. With the cut into wedges, the juicy corn kernels have the opportunity to turn extra-crisp, almost like fried corn.Similar to elote (Mexican street corn), you’ll slather the oven-baked corn ribs in a creamy, spiced spread while they’re still hot. Here a compound butter with smoked paprika, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, and garlic powder seasons the charred corn riblets with smoky, tangy flavor (not unlike your favorite store-bought BBQ sauce). If you like things spicy, amp it up with more black pepper or a pinch of chipotle powder. Or increase to 1 tsp. garlic powder for an extra savory kick.The corn ribs only need about 20 minutes in the oven and are ready once the kernels turn lightly charred and crispy. If you want to go the extra mile, garnish the seasoned corn ribs with a fluffy sprinkle of fresh herbs, like parsley or cilantro, and a squeeze of lemon or lime juice before serving. ",
    "ingredients": [
      "4 ears of corn, husked",
      "¼ cup vegetable oil",
      "¾ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more",
      "½ Freshly ground pepper",
      "1 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature",
      "1 Tbsp. light brown sugar",
      "1 tsp. apple cider vinegar",
      "¾ tsp. smoked paprika"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Preheat oven to 450°. Using a chef’s knife and securing your cutting board by placing a damp kitchen towel underneath, cut 4 ears of corn, husked, in half crosswise. Working one at a time, stand each piece up on a cut end and slice lengthwise into quarters (you should have 8 wedges per ear). Transfer to a baking sheet. Drizzle with ¼ cup vegetable oil, season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, and toss to coat. Spread out wedges evenly, arranging cut sides up.",
      "Roast corn 10 minutes, then turn cut sides down and continue\nto roast until kernels are tender and starting to blister and separate, about 10 minutes\nmore. (If you’d like more color, move corn to top rack and broil about 1 minute.) Let\ncool slightly.",
      "Meanwhile, mix together ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, 1 Tbsp. light brown sugar, 1 tsp. apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp. smoked paprika, ¾ tsp. garlic powder, and ¾ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a small bowl.",
      "Serve corn ribs with butter mixture for spreading over."

    "title": "Yellow Rice Pilaf",
    "description": "Spice-tinted yellow rice is a staple side dish across many cuisines. Some iterations get their yellow color from saffron or annatto, or by deploying a premade spice mix like sazón. This version from chef and cookbook author JJ Johnson relies on the dyeing power of turmeric for its golden glow. A little garlic powder and store-bought fried onions (which we like just as much as homemade ones, don’t tell anybody) bring in lots of savory flavor, meaning you can simply use water as the cooking medium. Have some chicken broth or the dregs of a store-bought stock you want to use up? Go ahead; we won’t tell.You’ll sauté the seasoning mix in butter on the stovetop before incorporating the rice to wake up the spices’ full range of flavors. Turmeric and garlic both burn quickly, so be attentive and have everything ready before you start. You can also consider this a blueprint ripe for experimentation: Swap out the garlic powder for a few sliced garlic cloves, add in ½ tsp. ground cumin or coriander, or toss in some dried fruit like currants or golden raisins to plump while the rice steams. Similarly, any variety of long-grain rice will do here. For the brightest color, stick to white rice; our weeknight go-tos are jasmine and basmati rice.Johnson often makes this easy yellow rice recipe to serve alongside a hearty main dish like roast chicken, but it would also be a great easy dinner alongside a plate of refried black beans and warm tortillas, or topped with steamed vegetables and a poached egg. The rice reheats well—but please, hold the fresh herbs until you’re ready to serve it. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator and microwave in 30-second bursts, or cook fried-rice style in olive oil or more butter to warm through.",
    "ingredients": [

      "Melt 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add seasoning blend and cook, stirring often, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup jasmine rice, rinsed until water runs clear, and cook, stirring often and reducing heat if needed to keep spices from scorching, until grains are coated and opaque around the edges, about 2 minutes.",
      "Pour in 1½ cups water and add 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt; stir to combine. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Cook until water is completely absorbed and rice is tender, 15–18 minutes.

      "Uncover rice and fluff gently with a fork. Transfer pilaf to a platter and top with chopped tender herbs (such as parsley or cilantro) if desired. Serve with lemon wedges if desired."

It means that if you have some summer fruit and a few slices of sandwich bread about to go stale, you’re just a few steps away from dessert. Any soft sliced bread will work, but white bread is particularly apt because of its inherent sweetness; when tossed with sugar and warm spices and coated with melted butter, it evokes the nostalgic flavors of cinnamon toast.

    "title": "Banana-Infused Rum Old-Fashioned",
    "description": "If you order an old-fashioned at a bar, chances are you’re expecting a whiskey cocktail. But seeing a rum old-fashioned recipe is not so unlikely. Take a glance at bartending books both classic and contemporary, and you’ll discover there’s no fixed recipe for the drink. The name refers to the method of preparation: A base spirit is softened and enhanced by the addition of sweetener, bitters, and citrus. An old-fashioned cocktail can be built with bourbon, mezcal, tequila—or any spirit you like (yes, even gin). Rum is my personal favorite—it has the depth of the more common rye old-fashioned but with lighter notes of flowers and fruit. It’s an easy way to put a fresh spin on an aged rum I’d otherwise drink neat.When I want to bring in some extra tropical flair, I replace the usual simple syrup or sugar cube with a dash of banana-infused rum. Often associated with tiki cocktail recipes or frozen drinks, I find the cordial shines in spirit-forward preparations. You can make it yourself by soaking dried banana chips in the spirit for at least one week. But if you just can’t wait, use a high-quality banana liqueur such as Tempus Fugit, Giffard, or Marie Brizard. Either way, a good banana booze is a fun addition to any home bar—and equally delicious as a replacement for the sugar syrup in a daiquiri. (Prefer to skip the banana? Sub in ¼ oz. demerara syrup.) A one-two punch of bitters (in the form of Angostura aromatic bitters and orange bitters) adds subtle, fragrant notes of allspice and cardamom. I finish the drink with an orange twist, but I don’t slip it into the drink since I only want the peel’s oils, not the extra bitterness that would seep into the glass as it rests in the liquid.",

    "description": "This recipe proves that spiced cured pork and delicate shellfish are a match made in one-skillet weeknight-dinner heaven. You’ll start by searing scallops on one side over high heat to develop a golden brown crust, then build a sauce from salty chorizo, lots of garlic, and bright Sun Gold tomatoes (you can use any variety of cherry tomatoes, but that vibrant yellow hue can’t be beat). Nestle the scallops back into the sauce for the last few minutes to cook through and serve with toast for a bright, satisfying meal that comes together in just 20 minutes.It’s worth it to seek out Spanish chorizo—a firm, cured pork product like salami—for this dish, if you can. Unlike Mexican chorizo, which is raw spiced ground pork sold loose or in sausage casings, the Spanish variety is well-salted and already cooked, so it only requires a minute or two in the pan to crisp up and render out some flavorful fat to sizzle with your sauce’s aromatic base.",

    "title": "Nuoc Cham Gazpacho",

Here you’ll blend those same flavors into a cold gazpacho base, playing up the natural sweetness of ripe heirloom tomatoes. To help emulsify the mixture, sesame oil stands in for the traditional olive oil, providing nutty balance and helping to curb the heat.",

    "title": "Gochujang-Glazed Fried Chicken Sandwich",
    "description": "Chances are, if you want a crispy slab of chicken sandwiched inside a squishy bun, swaddled by a creamy sauce, and topped with tangy pickles, you want it today. Not tomorrow, not two days from now. A craving for a fried chicken sandwich is often satisfied by ordering one at a restaurant, since many recipes involve more time than most of us are willing to wait. So when I set out to make my ideal version, my guiding principle was speed without sacrificing flavor. That means this recipe is makeable in an hour. Watch the full development process here. I realized early on that I’d have to avoid a wet brine to save time. Wet brines for fried chicken, which often feature buttermilk, need hours for the enzymes in the dairy to tenderize the proteins in the chicken. They can take up to a day to make a difference in texture and flavor. Instead, I used a dry brine with salt, garlic powder, and other seasonings that grab onto the chicken and don’t let go. Speaking of which: skinless, boneless chicken thighs were the clear winner when it came to convenience, plus they’re perfectly sized for sandwich duty.I explored creating the crispy shell of batter that’s emblematic of Korean approaches to fried chicken, but found the only way to unleash its full potential was to double-fry, involving two oil temperatures. So instead for ease, I used a seasoned dry dredge with 50% potato starch (cornstarch also works) and 50% all-purpose flour, following an egg wash for extra adhesion.Where Korean-style fried chicken continued to inspire me, however, was in the glaze. I made a fast sauce with gochujang, brown sugar, and rice vinegar to paint mouthwatering heat onto the chicken, nodding to both Korean fried chicken and Nashville hot chicken techniques. Lacquering the top of the chicken rather than tossing it directly in the glaze preserves more of the crisp coating and keeps the flavor in check. To finish the sandwiches, I love bread-and-butter pickles, dill mayo, and a stack of shredded iceberg; but whatever you choose, make it fast and enjoy the fruits of an hour well spent.",

    "title": "Red Coconut Curry With Sockeye Salmon",
    "description": "Imbued with richness from coconut milk and robust flavor from lemongrass and ginger, this Thai-style salmon curry recipe from Emma Teal Laukitis and Claire Neaton’s book The Salmon Sisters: Harvest & Heritage is ideal for showcasing wild salmon, such as Sockeye or Coho. But there is one major rule you just can’t break: using full-fat coconut milk. Leaner than its farmed counterparts, wild salmon requires the lush texture of regular coconut milk to ensure it doesn’t dry out. (The lower-fat stuff is also thickened with stabilizers that can break down and lead to off flavors in the final dish.) Plus, poaching wild salmon fillets over low heat in the fragrant coconut curry sauce keeps the fish tender and butter-soft.When shopping for fish, choose a skinless fillet. If you can’t find one, ask the fish butcher at your grocery store to remove the skin for you. Or just go ahead and poach the salmon pieces with the skin on; it’ll be easier to remove after the fish has been cooked. (It’s also totally fine to eat.)The surprise ingredient here might be the honey. Rather than making the broth noticeably sweet, it simply rounds out the savory spice and heat brought on by red curry paste and fresh chiles. Fragrant jasmine rice is a natural complement to this weeknight-dinner-ready coconut curry salmon, but any long-grain white rice will do. Similarly, you can swap the basil for whatever soft herbs you’ve got in your garden or refrigerator drawer: fresh cilantro, mint, chives, or a combination would all add the required fresh finish.For more salmon curry recipes, try salmon paka, an East African fish curry that starts with crispy-skinned seared salmon fillets, or this rice bowl with salmon and Thai-curry-spiced creamed spinach.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Oatmeal Cookies",
    "description": "This recipe for chewy oatmeal cookies results in an amped-up version of the childhood favorite, with pecans for nutty, crunchy interest and your choice of dried fruit to make them personal. (Raisin haters, this one’s for you. Raisin lovers, it’s for you too.)But be warned: Don’t try to make these with quick-cooking oats. Quick oats are rolled thinner than old-fashioned oats (sometimes called rolled oats). The two absorb liquids at different rates; swap the quick-cooking version into this recipe, and you’ll end up with dry, cakey cookies instead of buttery ones. For extra nutty flavor, we toast the oats (and pecans) before stirring them into the cookie dough, resulting in the best oatmeal cookies of your life.Of course, there are a few other contributing factors. We use a high proportion of brown sugar, plus a glug of maple syrup, to boost the cookies’ classic butterscotch notes. And, perhaps most important, we made them choose-you-own-mix-in-adventure cookies. We’re well aware that not everyone loves a raisin (just ask half our colleagues). So scour your cabinet for the dried fruit you like best and use it instead. Traditionalist? Oatmeal-raisin cookies it is. Cherry lover? Ginger fiend? Current connoisseur? Go your own way. (Looking for a chocolate chip oatmeal cookie recipe? We’ve arranged that elsewhere.)The dough should rest at least 1 hour after mixing (but before forming) so the dry ingredients have time to hydrate fully—you can also make the dough a day ahead, cover it well, and stick it in the fridge overnight. Use an ice cream or cookie scoop to portion the dough. For the chewiest oatmeal cookies, reduce the baking time by 2 minutes—if you prefer crisper ones, flatten the dough balls slightly before baking.",

    "title": "Sweet Potato Fries With Sriracha Dip",
    "description": "This recipe for oven-baked sweet potato fries is a good one to keep in your back pocket. It’s far simpler than making french fries, requires almost no prep time, and once you master the basic recipe, it’s infinitely riffable.We like our sweet potato fries in hardy wedges with the crispy peel still attached, but you could opt for disks or squared-off sticks and peel them first if preferred. The important thing is to make sure they’re all relatively the same thickness so that they char and crisp evenly. For the best sweet potato fries, pat the tubers dry before tossing them with the oil. For roasting, use the largest sheet pan you’ve got; more surface area means crispier fries (if you only have small pans, cook the sweet potatoes in batches). For the same reason, don’t be tempted to line the pan with parchment paper, which would act as an insulator, preventing the potatoes from developing a crust.We keep the flavors here simple with just salt and pepper, but you should feel free to mix it up by dusting the uncooked sweet potatoes with some smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, chili powder, or garlic powder. For extra-crispy sweet potato fries, add up to 1 tsp. cornstarch or ¼ tsp. baking soda to your spice mix—both will promote even more browning. To serve, we’re partial to this creamy, spicy dipping sauce, but tahini ketchup or a bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce would also make a great match.",

    "title": "Red-Wine-Braised Brisket",
    "description": "The key to the best brisket rests on one thing: a slow-cooking method. Whether that be smoking a Texas-BBQ-style cut of meat or simmering a holiday-ready version in an herby red wine braise (as we do here), depends on the mood you’d like to evoke. Either way, fork-tender brisket can be yours, whether it’s your first time hosting dinner or your 50th.Look for a 5-pound brisket labeled “flat cut” or “first cut.” It’s leaner than the point or deckle, but it does come with a fat cap. If your butcher hasn’t cut away this excess layer of fat, trim it yourself to no more than ¼\" thick. Use a pan with plenty of space to brown the large piece of meat (if you don’t have one, cut the brisket in half and brown one piece at a time), and a roasting pan that can accommodate the aromatics and braising liquid.As with most beef brisket recipes, this one has a long cook time (about 3½ hours), but it’s mostly hands-off. Let the meat rest for at least 30 minutes on a platter or cutting board with a well or grooves before slicing it against the grain into thin ribbons.One vital step before serving: Discard the vegetables used to flavor the sauce. After such lengthy cooking, they’ll be mushy and flavorless, having given everything they had to the broth. Cooking fresh young carrots and pearl onions to serve alongside may feel superfluous, but this ensures you have a crisp-tender, golden-browned side dish. You’ll also want some mashed potatoes, polenta, or crispy potatoes to soak up the richly flavored jus.Once you’ve got the handle on braising brisket, try corned beef or flash-grilling brisket slices with a bunch of garlic cloves and a brown sugar-soy marinade.",

    "title": "Frozen Negroni",
    "description": "This frozen version of the classic negroni recipe is slushy, bittersweet, and just strong enough. Preferably slurped in the sun by a pool, it starts with the traditional 1:1:1 ratio of gin, vermouth, and Campari, then gets a dose of citrusy brightness from the addition of orange juice. OJ does double duty here, working not only to balance the drink’s flavors but also to lower its ABV—the key to creating a mixture that will stay frozen for longer than all of three minutes. The result is a smooth, refreshing cocktail that promises to be your new warm weather fave, whether you’re a devotee of the original or prefer something less intense and more gulpable. If you fall into the latter camp, consider using store-bought orange juice for an extra boost of sweetness to offset the wonderfully bitter notes of Campari.You’ll need a blender for this recipe, and a bit of foresight—freezing the mixture in advance is an essential step for a slushy consistency. This recipe makes eight drinks, and I recommend you make it in full (or go ahead and double it), even if you’re serving fewer people. Keep any remaining mixture stashed in your freezer for drinks on demand all summer long.",

      "When ready to serve, transfer 1 container of negroni base to a blender and add 4 cups ice. Blend on high speed until drink is thick and smooth. Divide among 4 glasses and garnish with orange slices. Repeat with remaining negroni base and another 4 cups ice if making all 8 servings, or save for another sunny day.",

Red curry paste adds deep flavors of chili peppers, lemongrass, makrut lime, and shallots. Store-bought rotisserie chicken makes this meal come together fast. And the combination of fresh vegetables like celery and herbs provides a crisp, refreshing contrast to the bold spiciness of the curry paste.

Ripe pear, salty soy sauce, bright ginger, and warm gochugaru chile flakes come together in a bulgogi-inspired blender marinade that infuses tofu slabs with big flavor and helps them char over a hot grill. Pressing the tofu for at least 15 minutes is vital to release as much moisture as possible, which primes the slabs to take on the marinade.After marinating the tofu, you’ll bulk up what remains of the rich marinade with a scoop of gochujang and use it in a few more applications. First, to glaze the tofu as it grills; then you’ll whisk in a spoonful of mayonnaise to make an easy, creamy burger sauce. Because you’ve only used the mixture to marinade tofu—rather than raw meat—you can use it without needing to cook it down first.",

    "title": "Vegan Tomato Soup With Cashew Cream",
    "description": "You don’t need an immersion blender, Instant Pot, or even a large saucepan for this vegan tomato soup recipe. Nearly everything happens right in your trusty high-speed blender. We swear by the Vitamix, which generates so much heat at its highest setting, it can cook soup all on its own. No need for fresh tomatoes, either. Canned tomatoes guarantee bright, concentrated, dependable flavor—but skip the diced ones, which are preserved to hold their shape and won’t purée as smoothly as the crushed or whole varieties.The creaminess here comes from a near-instant homemade cashew cream (no soaking needed), which adds body to the tomato soup and doubles as a pretty garnish. Meanwhile, red curry paste brings in dynamic flavor, while sugar balances the acidity of the tomatoes. For the most velvety soup, reduce the blender speed toward the end to eliminate a lot of the foam that rises to the top. And don’t be tempted to double the recipe—as the soup heats it needs room to expand. Overfilling your blender could cause it to erupt. Instead, make the soup in batches if you want extra (pro tip: It freezes beautifully).This silky vegan tomato soup is also gluten-free; to keep it that way, top it with, crispy chickpeas for a little crunch. If you’re dairy-free but gluten-friendly, trying toasted sourdough croutons and a sprinkling of vegan Parmesan for grilled cheese sandwich vibe—minus the cheese.Looking for more veggie-full vegan soup recipes? Try a soul-warming red lentil soup, coconutty bean stew, or Italian ribollita (omit the Parmesan to make it vegan).

    "title": "Jerk Shrimp With Pineapple Salad",
    "description": "Commonly recognized as a hallmark of Caribbean cuisine, jerk shrimp stands alongside jerk chicken as one of Jamaica’s signature dishes. Many recipes for this bright, summery grilled shrimp dinner start with a homemade jerk seasoning marinade (a mixture of puréed Scotch bonnet peppers, allspice, ginger, and a host of other aromatics that might include bell peppers, habaneros, soy sauce, jalapeños, brown sugar, fresh thyme, and more). Others may rely on a premade spice blend with an equally long list, including cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. This Jamaican jerk shrimp recipe, however, comes together quickly thanks to a scoop of store-bought jerk seasoning paste—we like Walkerswood Traditional Jamaican jerk paste—which acts as an instant flavor enhancer for the seafood.You can use fresh or frozen shrimp for this dish; if buying fresh, look for large or jumbo deveined shrimp, and if using frozen, thaw the shrimp in the refrigerator overnight. Marinate the raw shrimp for at least 30 minutes (and up to 8 hours; any longer and the shrimp will start to get mushy).To balance the heat, pair the jerk shrimp with a citrusy, herbaceous pineapple salad. If you’re nervous about cutting a fresh pineapple, follow our guide for tips. No fresh pineapples to be found? Opt for a mango salsa. Serve as is, or tuck everything into tortillas for shrimp tacos, or pile onto a plate with grilled vegetables.Explore more of our best shrimp recipes, including garlic butter shrimp, shrimp pasta, and more →",

    "title": "Apple Butter",
    "description": "This recipe for homemade apple butter is the solution to post-u-pick-orchard drama: when you realize that the extra 10 pounds of apples you brought home might have been overkill. (Or that some of them aren’t entirely worth eating out of hand.) It’s a natural topping for an autumnal French toast bake, and it’s equally delicious spread on waffles and English muffins, layered into an Appalachian apple stack cake, or dolloped over ice cream or even pork chops. And as a bonus, this easy recipe will make your house smell like an orchard.Ask the internet how to make apple butter, and you’ll get 285 million results. Popular approaches include using a pressure cooker to speed up the cook time and a hands-off slow-cooker method (which actually doesn’t work so well since it traps moisture). Starting apple butter on the stovetop and finishing it in the oven achieves our desired consistency (spreadable, lush), plus rich color and flavor. We opted for the warming notes of whole, not ground, cinnamon and cloves here, but you should feel free to play around. Add some allspice berries, cardamom pods, or a few strips of lemon zest; bury a vanilla bean into the mix or splash in some vanilla extract. Whatever you love in an apple pie will be excellent here.Aim for a mix of tart and sweet apples like Granny Smith, Fuji, McIntosh, Honeycrisp, and Golden Delicious—or whatever you brought home from apple picking. You want flavorful apples, but they don’t necessarily need to be the best “baking apples” (which tend to hold their shape when cooked). Here, we want the fruit to fall apart. Chop, but don’t peel or core them, since the skins amp up the apple flavor and the core adds pectin, which helps the apple butter set.If it’s applesauce you’re after, stop after you pass the apple mixture through the food mill or sieve. Otherwise, transfer the mixture to the oven to thicken it and concentrate the flavor. It’s ready when it’s dark brown and reduced by half.",

    "title": "Mumbo Sauce",
    "description": "What do you get when you remix barbecue sauce to be a little bit sweeter and quite a bit spicier? A spectacular vermillion-hued condiment known as mumbo sauce or mambo sauce, depending on who you ask. With its ketchupy, vinegary base, this sweet-and-sour sauce is a staple at Chinese American carryout spots and soul food restaurants in predominantly Black neighborhoods in both Chicago and Washington, DC. Where it originated is up for debate. Chicago proponents trace the sauce to a Mississippi man, Argia B. Collins, who settled on the west side of Chicago in the 1940s. In the ’50s, Collins established what would become a renowned restaurant, where he introduced his piquant barbecue sauce. It was such a hit, he trademarked the name Mumbo Sauce and started selling it by the bottle. Meanwhile, DC mumbo sauce fans contend that the condiment was invented at Wings-n-Things, an area restaurant famous for its fried foods, in the 1960s. And these days Capital City Mambo Sauce is a popular DC brand.Whatever its provenance, mumbo sauce gets its signature flavor from various means. Our version pulls in tropical sweetness from pineapple juice, earthy warmth from white pepper, and tangy heat from Louisiana-style hot sauce. The result is bright, punchy, and viscous. Keep a batch in the fridge and use it to slather ribs, glaze chicken wings, and marinate fish or as a dipping sauce for french fries and egg rolls.  ",

    "title": "Almond-Raspberry Thumbprint Cookies",
    "description": "This raspberry thumbprint cookie recipe from cookbook author Claire Saffitz is loosely based on ricciarelli, an almond cookie native to Siena, Italy. It results in tender, macaron-like bites that are crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle—but require a fraction of the time, effort, and technical skill to make.They’re flavored with raspberry from all angles: tangy, bright raspberry preserves or jam gets added to the dough and spooned into the thumbprint indentation, and pulverized freeze-dried raspberries get mixed with powdered sugar to provide a snowy pink finish.Even though the cookies look fancy, no special equipment is required. A stand mixer is helpful for the meringue, but an electric handheld one also works. You can use a tablespoon measure to portion the cookie dough into approximately 1\" balls, but a cookie scoop works wonders for consistency and faster rolling. While you can make them ahead (see tips at the bottom of the recipe), they’re best eaten on the day they’re baked while the edges are still crispy. Let them cool on the cookie sheet before transferring to a cooling rack so they hold together.If you’re packing these up as gifts for the holiday season, consider pairing them with more of our favorite cookies, like buttery pistachio thumbprint cookies, Colombian galletitas (similar to a Linzer cookie) with apricot jam, and crumbly zebra-striped shortbread cookies.This recipe was adapted from ‘What’s for Dessert’ by Claire Saffitz.

    "ingredients": [
      "2¼ cups (216 g) almond flour or   almond meal",
      "1 tsp. baking soda",
      "½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp.   Morton kosher salt",
      "1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest",
      "1 tsp. vanilla extract",
      "½ tsp. almond extract",
      "3 Tbsp. plus ½ cup seedless raspberry jam",
      "2 large egg whites, room temperature",
      "⅓ cup (67 g) granulated sugar",
      "½ cup plus ⅓ cup (92 g total)   powdered sugar",
      "1 cup (28 g) freeze-dried raspberries"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Whisk 2¼ cups (216 g) almond flour or almond meal, 1 tsp. baking soda, and ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl to combine. Set dry ingredients aside. Stir 1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, ½ tsp. almond extract, and 3 Tbsp. raspberry jam in a small bowl until combined and smooth. Set jam mixture aside.",
      "Using an electric mixer on medium-low speed, beat 2 large egg whites, room temperature, in a large bowl (preferably non-plastic) until frothy, about 20 seconds. Increase speed to medium-high and continue to beat until foamy and opaque, about 30 seconds. Beating constantly, add ⅓ cup (67 g) granulated sugar in a slow, steady stream. Once all of the sugar has been added, increase speed to high and continue to beat just until stiff peaks form and meringue is dense and glossy.",
      "Add reserved dry ingredients to meringue and gently fold in with a rubber spatula to combine. Scrape in reserved jam mixture and fold until evenly mixed and a stiff, tacky dough forms. (The baking soda will react with the acidity in the jam and turn the batter grayish. Don’t be alarmed; this is normal.) Cover bowl and chill dough until cold and slightly firm, 1–1½ hours.",
      "Scoop out a rounded tablespoonful of dough from bowl and roll it between your palms to form a smooth sphere. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. (If the dough sticks to your palms, dampen them lightly with a little water.) Repeat with remaining dough. You should have about 22 total. Chill cookie dough balls in freezer, uncovered, until cold and no longer tacky to the touch (they should not be frozen solid), about 30 minutes.",
      "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325°. Place ½ cup (55 g) powdered sugar in a small bowl (sift into bowl if it’s lumpy). Remove dough balls from freezer and, working one at a time, toss in powdered sugar until generously and completely coated. Place on another parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 2\" apart. (You should be able to fit all the dough balls on the same baking sheet; they will spread only a little when they bake.)",
      "Bake cookies, rotating baking sheet front to back after 10 minutes, until surfaces are crinkled and edges are golden brown, 12–15 minutes. Remove from oven and press the end of the handle of a wooden spoon straight down into the center of each cookie, wiggling slightly, to make a divot (be careful not to press all the way through). Let cookies cool on baking sheet, then carefully peel away from parchment paper and transfer to a wire rack.",
      "Place 1 cup (28 g) freeze-dried raspberries in a small resealable plastic bag, press out all of the air, and seal. Using a rolling pin, meat mallet, or heavy saucepan, crush raspberries to a fine powder. Add remaining ⅓ cup (37 g) powdered sugar to bag, seal again, and shake to combine. Transfer raspberry sugar to a fine-mesh sieve and shake over cookies to coat. (Sift any remaining raspberry sugar into an airtight container. Cover and store at room temperature for another use; discard any larger pieces left behind in the sieve.)",
      "Heat remaining ½ cup raspberry jam in a small saucepan over medium-low, whisking occasionally, just until fluid (or, heat jam in 20-second bursts in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave). Remove from heat and, using a teaspoon, fill divot in each cookie with warm jam. Let cookies sit until jam is mostly set, 15–20 minutes.",
      "Do ahead: Cookies can be assembled 3 days ahead. (The jam will cause the cookies to soften over time, but they will still be delicious.) Stack in an airtight container, separating layers with sheets of parchment paper. Store at room temperature. Uncoated, unfilled cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to 1 day. Coat in the raspberry sugar and fill with jam before serving.\nEditor’s note: Head this way for more of our favorite Christmas cookie recipes →"

    "title": "Alabama White Sauce",
    "description": "You could create a map of the South based on regional barbecue sauces alone. Think of North Carolina’s tangy vinegar sauce, or South Carolina’s spicy mustard sauce. In Alabama, the state’s signature sauce is a punchy, peppery, mayo-based condiment first popularized in 1925 at Big Bob Gibson’s Bar-B-Q in Decatur, one of the oldest smoke joints in the country. Today, you’ll find Alabama white sauce served with grilled or smoked chicken at barbecue joints across the state, especially in northern Alabama.This atypical barbecue sauce recipe starts with mayonnaise (Duke’s is the go-to choice for many, but whatever you keep on hand will work) and is dialed up with a good glug of distilled white vinegar (feel free to swap in apple cider vinegar for a fruitier flavor). Buttermilk gives our version extra tang, which is rounded out by brown sugar, while cayenne pepper adds a kiss of heat. But the real star of this sauce is the freshly cracked black pepper—a whole tablespoon of it. Instead of cranking away on a tiny pepper mill, save yourself some trouble and crush whole black peppercorns in a mortar and pestle or electric spice mill.While Alabama white sauce is usually served with smoked meats, this versatile condiment holds endless possibilities. Use it for basting grilled chicken breasts, pork chops, or brisket. Toss chicken wings in it (or dunk them in a sidecar of the sauce) for an excellent appetizer. Use it as a dressing for coleslaw or salad (it might just dethrone ranch as your go-to salad dressing). Serve it as a dipping sauce for french fries or fried green tomatoes. Or pair it with Sweet-Tea-Brined Fried Chicken for a match made in…well, Alabama.",

    "title": "Migas",
    "description": "When you have a stack of waning corn tortillas, your first thought should be this easy migas recipe. Like crusty baguettes and morning newspapers, fresh tortillas seemingly have a 24-hour lifespan, quickly turning brittle and leathery. No amount of careful reheating seems to revive them. But, cut up and crisped in a pan with a splash of oil? Transformative. Suddenly, a stack of stale, crumbly tortillas is full of promise.Sometimes confused for chilaquiles (a dish of crispy tortilla strips coated with salsa and often topped with a fried egg), migas is a Mexican breakfast and brunch staple that translates to “crumbs” (its Spanish ancestor is made with breadcrumbs). Mexican and Tex-Mex migas comprise fried corn tortillas laced with fluffy scrambled eggs and topped with any number of flavorful garnishes: spicy chorizo, pico de gallo, guacamole, refried beans, Cotija cheese, the list goes on. This version requires just a few ingredients, all of them economical, and most of them likely in your kitchen already. Can you use store-bought tortilla chips? Because they’re often thin and brittle, we don’t recommend it. Milk and cornstarch stretch the eggs a bit further and render them impossibly silky. Bulked up with a scoop of refried beans and a simple tomato salad on the side, these migas are an affordable breakfast, lunch, or dinner—and salvation for those leftover tortillas.Editor’s note: Click through for our guide to eating well in Mexico City, or head over here for more of our best breakfast recipes →",

    "title": "Sweet-Tea-Brined Chicken With Alabama White Sauce",
    "description": "Two Southern staples in their own right, sweet tea and fried chicken are often found on the same table. But it wasn’t until I tasted the sweet-tea fried chicken sandwich from Saw’s BBQ in Birmingham, Alabama, that I realized they’re even more powerful together. In this recipe, inspired by the dish from Saw’s, sweet tea acts as a flavor-charged brine for chicken thighs, resulting in tender, ultra-succulent fried chicken with a lingering hint of sweetness.For the brine, I take a cue from the age-old Southern secret of spiking sweet tea with a pinch of baking soda. This trick is said to strip the tea of any lingering bitterness, but adding a little baking soda to the brine also performs the valuable role of tenderizing the meat. Instead of deep-frying, I opt for a shallow-fry in a cast-iron skillet, which yields spectacularly crispy, craggy chicken with a fraction of the oil.The ultimate companion for sweet-tea-brined chicken? Alabama white sauce. Unlike many barbecue sauces—which lean heavily on ketchup and molasses—this pale mayonnaise-and-vinegar-based one is bright and punchy, a trademark of Alabama barbecue. Laced with plenty of black pepper, this versatile white sauce would be great on just about anything: In Alabama, it’s most commonly slathered on grilled or smoked chicken—the thin mayo-based sauce keeps the bird moist and juicy—but I also use it as a salad dressing and a dipping sauce for fries (Big Ranch Energy).My favorite way to serve this chicken is over a slice of soft white bread to sop up all that sauce. For an epic chicken sandwich, tuck the fried thighs into a plush potato bun along with sliced pickles and a hefty spoonful of Alabama white sauce. Whichever way you choose, don’t forget a side of fried green tomatoes.",

    "title": "Crispy Fried Shallots",
    "description": "Crispy fried shallots are like Calabrian chile paste and sambal—they make just about everything better. Use them to top fried rice, garnish a Thai-inspired mango salad, or swap them in for the fried onions in this green bean casserole. While you can buy fried shallots at many Asian supermarkets, it’s easy and rather satisfying to make a batch at home. Getting crispy, not burned ones, requires a bit of technique and patience. Using a mandoline slicer ensures the cuts are even. Instead of dropping the sliced shallots into a saucepan of hot oil on the stovetop, you’ll start them in cold oil, guaranteeing every ring is perfectly caramelized throughout. Don’t step away from the kitchen while they fry. Stirring them often with a fork helps keep the rings separate; when they start to brown, stand by, they can go from golden brown to burnt in the blink of an eye.While some recipes have you remove the shallots from the oil with a slotted spoon, we find a fine mesh strainer is easiest and creates less of a mess to clean up. Transfer the shallots to a large paper-towel-lined plate or baking sheet and seasoned them immediately. Hold on to that frying oil, too: Once cooled, it retains that cooked onion flavor and is an excellent condiment for salads, stir-fries, and more.Read all about shallots in our guide →",

    "title": "BA’s Best Blueberry Pie",
    "description": "When former BA food editor Rick Martinez first posted a slice of his homemade blueberry pie on social media, the recipe proved to be something of a love potion. “Men I knew well, men I had dated, significant exes, total strangers, everyone messaged me they ‘needed that pie right now’ and would do whatever it takes to get it,” he writes. The dessert scored him a few “9-inch pie and chill” situations. It’s that good.Rick’s trick? It’s all about showcasing perfect summer berries (though even ho-hum out-of-season blueberries can shine here) and achieving the right crust-to-filling ratio. You’ll need a deep-dish pie pan, which allows you to cram 8 cups of blueberries into the pie filling. If you take your fruit pies with little spice, you can add up to ½ tsp. cardamom or coriander to enhance the berries’ fruitiness, or 1 tsp. ground cinnamon or ginger for a touch of warmth.As for Rick’s pie crust recipe: It makes for a dough that’s so flaky, some mistook it for puff pastry, a texture achieved through fraisage (a.k.a. smashing the butter into thin sheets with your hands, see a demonstration in Rick’s apple pie video). To decorate the pie, you can’t beat an intertwined lattice top—but, if you prefer a solid top crust, be sure to cut a few vents in the dough.The bubbling filling needs time to settle before you slice in, so let your blueberry pie rest for at least four hours before serving it—perchance to a date.",
    "ingredients": [
      "3½ cups (437 g) all-purpose flour",
      "2 Tbsp. (25 g) granulated sugar",
      "1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "1½ cups (3 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces",
      "¼ cup chilled vodka",
      "2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice",
      "4 pt. fresh blueberries, rinsed, drained",
      "5 Tbsp. (35 g) cornstarch",
      "1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest",
      "2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice",
      "¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or Morton kosher salt",
      "¾ cup raw sugar (139 g) or granulated sugar (150 g), plus more for crust",
      "1 All-purpose flour (for dusting)"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Whisk 3½ cups (437 g) all-purpose flour, 2 Tbsp. (25 g) granulated sugar, and 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a large bowl. Toss 1½ cups (3 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces, in dry ingredients with your fingertips to evenly coat. Working quickly and aggressively, rub butter into dry ingredients with your fingertips and palms to smash butter into flour and incorporate completely, creating some pieces that are flat and thin and some that are pea-size and irregular.",
      "Stir ¼ cup chilled vodka, 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, and ¼ cup ice water (vodka makes a flakier, more tender crust; if you’d rather leave it out, use ½ cup ice water) in a small bowl. Drizzle over dough, then mix with a fork until shaggy pieces form. Knead in bowl with your hands a couple of times until a shaggy dough forms (it will look quite dry, which is exactly what it should look like). Transfer large clumps of dough to a work surface. Drizzle 1 Tbsp. ice water over remaining smaller bits of dough in bowl and knead again to bring it together. Add to dough on work surface.",
      "Divide dough in half. Working with one half, press it together into a single mass, incorporating dry bits, then pat down to make a ¾\"-thick block. Using a bench scraper or knife, divide block into 4 pieces. Stack pieces on top of one another, tucking any unincorporated dry bits in between layers, and press down to combine, flattening into one mass again. Form dough into a ¾\"-thick disk and wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Keeping dough wrapped in plastic, use your fingertips and the heels of your palms to press in any rough spots or remaining dry bits of dough around edges. Chill at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight.",
      "Do ahead: Dough can be made 5 days ahead. Keep chilled, or freeze up to 1 month.",
      "Toss 4 pt. fresh blueberries, rinsed, drained, 5 Tbsp. (35 g) cornstarch, 1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest, 2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, ¼ tsp. kosher salt, and ¾ cup raw sugar (139 g) or granulated sugar (150 g) in a large bowl. Let blueberry mixture sit 30 minutes to soften berries and extract juices.",
      "Meanwhile, let dough sit at room temperature 5 minutes to soften. Working one at a time, roll out disks on a lightly floured surface to ⅛\" thick (about 16\" in diameter) with a rolling pin. Transfer one round to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and chill while you make lattice. Cut remaining round into twelve 1\" strips. Place another piece of parchment over whole round on baking sheet, then transfer strips to parchment and chill.",
      "Position oven rack in center of oven; preheat to 425°. Line another rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and place in oven.",
      "Carefully transfer whole dough round to pie dish (make sure it’s a deep pie dish—super critical). Lift up edges and allow dough to slump down into dish (if it’s too cold to be pliable, let it warm up slightly first). Gently press dough into edges of dish, if needed. Trim, leaving about a ½\" overhang. Gently scrape in blueberry filling and smooth top.",
      "Beat 1 large egg with 1 tsp. water in a small bowl. Lay 6 dough strips vertically across filling so that they are parallel to each other, leaving about ½\" between them. (Tip: It’s easiest to start in the middle and work outward.)",
      "Rotate pie plate about 15° (if the top of the pie is the 12 o’clock mark, turn it to 2 o’clock). Lay another 6 strips vertically over first set so that they create a tight angle, or narrow “X” pattern, at the points where they cross. Very little filling should be visible; the dough will shrink, and these gaps will widen as pie bakes. Advanced bakers (you know who you are): weave the lattice, if desired. Trim dough ends so strips overhang bottom round by ½\". Working around edge of pie plate, fold loose ends under bottom round, pinching each gently to seal. Crimp edges decoratively, if desired. Brush edges and lattice lightly with egg wash, then sprinkle surface with raw sugar.",
      "Transfer pie dish to freezer and chill 10 minutes. Transfer pie dish to preheated baking sheet. Bake pie 5 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 375°. Continue to bake until crust is deep golden brown and juices are thick and vigorously bubbling, 75–90 minutes (check at the 60- and 75-minute marks and loosely tent with foil if it seems to be overbrowning; the juices will start to bubble at around 75 minutes but will thicken and bubble faster in the last 15 minutes of cook time, so don’t be tempted to pull it out until the bubbles are really going). If using a clear pie dish, check underneath to make sure bottom crust is evenly browned.",
      "Transfer pie to a wire rack and let cool at least 4 hours before serving. Yes, it smells amazing, and yes, people love warm pie. But if you don’t give it time to set up properly, the filling will be runny when you cut into it. Serve with vanilla ice cream (if using).",
      "Do ahead: Pie can be made 1 day ahead. Let cool, then cover with foil and store at room temperature.",

    "title": "Cajun Chicken With Peach Salsa",
    "description": "Sure, you could make a homemade Cajun seasoning blend from scratch—or you could save some time and make this Cajun chicken recipe with a store-bought blend. The grocery shortcut provides a whirlwind of flavor without the need to pull every last spice out of your cupboard.Most store-bought Cajun seasonings will include one or more types of chiles (hot and/or sweet paprika, cayenne pepper, and other varieties of dried red pepper) as well as salt, black pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and onion powder. But the quantities vary by brand: Some are spicier or saltier than others, so taste yours (stir a little into Greek yogurt and actually give it a taste), then adjust the amount of salt in this recipe accordingly.We like to use juicy, flavorful chicken thighs for this easy recipe, but you can easily swap in skinless, boneless chicken breasts if that’s what you have on hand. Sear the chicken in a heavy skillet (we like cast iron here), or if weather permits, take it out to the grill.Cajun chicken pairs well with mashed potatoes or rice and sautéed veggies like zucchini or bell peppers. We’ve taken the dish in a more summery direction with a sweet-and-sour peach salsa garnish. If peak-season peaches aren’t readily available, feel free to swap in frozen diced peaches. Store leftover chicken in an airtight container and reheat for a quick lunch or a simple dinner.Want more Louisiana classics?

    "title": "Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies With Toffee",
    "description": "This recipe for brown butter chocolate chip cookies will ruin you for all other cookies. It comes from BA subscriber Kate Davis, a winner in our 2017 Readers’ Choice Week contest. Davis’s recipe produces cookies with crispy, lacy edges and gooey centers studded with lots of melty chocolate. Then there’s the kicker: crunchy bits of buttery toffee candy.The key to the best chocolate chip cookies is in the details. Here, that means simmering melted butter until the milk solids turn golden brown and give off a nutty aroma. Don’t even think about straining out those brown bits: they’re imbued with toasty, rich flavor that will enhance the cookies’ caramel-like notes. Davis also opts for high-end bittersweet chocolate wafers—not chocolate chips, or even chocolate chunks—which melt into pools that defy logic, remaining molten days after baking. Last: Yes, it is important to bring the ingredients to room temperature before you start mixing. If you want chewy, perfect chocolate chip cookies, don’t skip it.Letting the dough rest before shaping gives the chocolate-strewn brown-butter toffee cookies time to meld, hydrating the dough and marrying all the flavors. If you want to make them ahead, shape and then freeze the cookie dough balls in a single layer on a cookie sheet. When frozen, transfer them to a Zip Top bag or other airtight container for up to three months.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Snickerdoodles",
    "description": "Whether you like your snickerdoodle cookies cakey or chewy, this recipe has you covered. The secret to changing up their texture lies in how long you beat the cookie batter. For classic snickerdoodles with a cakey bite, beat for a full 3 minutes after adding the eggs (set a timer: it’s longer than you think). This aerates the dough, leading to a striking crackly surface. For chewy snickerdoodle cookies, beat for just 30 seconds; their centers will be slightly more dense, preferable to some, and equally lovable in our books.Either way, our snickerdoodle cookie recipe minimizes prep time by calling for melted butter (i.e., no waiting around for softened). Cream of tartar gives them their signature tangy flavor. As for the other ingredients, there aren’t many, so choose wisely: Seek out a warm, potent cinnamon (we like this one from Burlap & Barrel) and a plump, shiny vanilla bean (if you can’t find one, substitute 1 tsp. ground vanilla or 1 Tbsp. vanilla bean paste or high-quality vanilla extract).No need to refrigerate the dough: Just let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes to firm up before scooping. Roll the cookie dough balls in cinnamon-sugar and give the buttery beauties plenty of room on your cookie sheet since they’ll spread quite a bit. These blonde cookies shouldn’t take on much color; don’t be tempted to leave them in the oven, lest you wind up with crispy cookies, which is not the vibe here. If you have extras—we doubt you’ll have extras—store them in an airtight container or pack them in holiday cookie tins. ’Tis the season for sharing.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Corn Chowder",
    "description": "This recipe for creamy corn chowder boasts layers upon layers of flavor. It starts with fresh summer sweet corn. Instead of relying on chicken broth, you’ll use the sheared cobs to make a Parmesan-corn broth for the chowder’s base. Want to make it year-round, even when corn’s not in season? You still won’t need store-bought stock. A combination of mushroom stems, fresh herbs, and cheese rinds make for a tasty broth, even if the corn flavor won’t be as potent. Pro tip for midwinter corn chowder makers: Leave the canned corn on the shelf; frozen corn will taste fresher and have a better texture.Sautéing the corn kernels in butter before adding them to the soup pot concentrates their flavor—you’re looking to cook off most of the juices and pick up a bit of caramelization. You’ll deglaze the pan with white wine (a crisp, dry Pinot Grigio works well here) before sautéing a bit of diced thick-cut bacon in the same pan. For a vegetarian version, omit the bacon, but replace it with extra shiitake mushrooms and sauté them until golden brown (reserve some crispy bits for topping the soup) before adding in the rest of the veg.We like the creamy texture russet potatoes add here, but Yukon Gold potatoes are also good. We also go all in on richness, adding a dose of heavy cream. For a lighter broth, whole milk will be fine, but you could also use coconut milk for a vegan version (replace the butter with a dairy-free alternative).Need a little more guidance? Watch Carla make the corn chowder here. Can’t decide between corn or clam chowder? Try this combo soup recipe, which pairs briny shellfish with fresh corn.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Coconut Cream Pie",
    "description": "Think of this coconut cream pie recipe as a Samoa cookie in pie form. It’s crunchy, caramelly, creamy, and positively jam-packed with coconut flavor. There’s toasted coconut in the quick-and-easy graham cracker crust, coconut oil in the caramel, coconut milk in the custard, and big pieces of flaked coconut to top it all off. (Catch former BA editor Claire Saffitz making the pie here.) It’s easy to see why this is one of our favorite pies.Because of its many elements, prepping this pie is best approached in stages. Start with the homemade pie crust, which comes together in a food processor and gets a brief blind bake for toasty crunch. Bundled in plastic wrap, the pie shell can be left at room temperature for a day, or frozen in the pie plate for up to two weeks. The caramel, which adds that signature Samoa chew, can be made up to four days in advance.Save the creamy coconut filling for the day of serving. To amp up the flavor, Claire steeps a whole vanilla bean in half-and-half, giving this pie filling a richer mouthfeel than ones that use whole milk. If you’d rather use vanilla extract, whisk in 1 Tbsp. extract after straining the custard.Sweetened whipped cream is our ideal topper for coconut cream pie. But, since you will have a few egg whites left over, you could easily make meringue instead: Whisk the egg whites with a bit of sugar to stiff peaks, mound the meringue on top of the pie, and don’t forget to toast it.For more custard pies, check out our Banana Cream Pie, Extremadura Almond Pie, Key Lime Pie, or Milk and Honey Pie recipes.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1¼ cups unsweetened finely shredded coconut",

With the motor running, stream in ¼ cup (½ stick) unsalted butter, melted, cooled, followed by 1 large egg yolk. Do not overprocess; you should have fine crumbs that are the texture of wet sand.",
      "Transfer mixture to pie plate and press firmly and evenly up sides and across the bottom. Place pan on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until crust is set and edges are brown, 12–18 minutes. Let cool.",
      "Do Ahead: Crust can be baked 1 day ahead. Let cool, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature, or freeze up to 2 weeks.",
      "Sprinkle a thin, even layer of sugar into a small heavy saucepan. Cook, undisturbed, over medium heat until mostly melted, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle another layer of sugar over and cook, stirring to incorporate granular sugar into melted sugar with a heatproof spatula, until melted, another minute or so. Repeat until you’ve used all sugar. Continue to cook, swirling saucepan (do not stir), until caramel is dark amber, about 30 seconds longer. Remove from heat and carefully pour in ¼ cup heavy cream, stirring to combine (caramel will sputter and seize up, but don’t worry).",
      "Return saucepan to low heat and cook, stirring, until any hardened bits of caramel are dissolved. Stir in 2 Tbsp. virgin coconut oil, melted, until mixture is smooth, then fold in ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. plus ⅛ tsp. Morton’s kosher salt and reserved ½ cup toasted coconut. Let caramel cool in pan, then scrape into cooled crust and use an offset spatula to spread in an even layer. Cover with plastic and chill.",

    "title": "Sheet-Pan Berry Shortcake",
    "description": "This giant berry shortcake reimagines a beloved summer staple and enlarges it to the umpteenth degree. Unlike traditional shortcakes, which get baked in individual portions, this version bundles the dough into one big slab to up the drama and make prepping easier too. (Learn more about the recipe development process here.) Once it’s cool, the slab gets topped with pompadour-ian peaks of whipped cream, made with vanilla extract and cream cheese. The latter ingredient not only gives the whipped cream subtle tang (an awesome pairing for ripe berries), but it also ensures the whipped cream stays plush and lofted as everyone eats. While you can throw any berry you have into the mix, the strawberries are essential: As they sit with the sugar and lemon juice, they macerate into a tart sauce, the perfect foil to all the sweetness. For a stress-free party, bake the shortcake the day before, and let it cool before loosely covering in plastic wrap. Then proceed with preparing the toppings right before serving.",
    "ingredients": [
      "14 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter",
      "4½ cups (563 g) all-purpose flour",

Add frozen butter and toss to coat, then pinch into pea-size pieces (some larger pieces are okay).",
      "Whisk 1 large egg, 2 cups heavy cream, and 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract in a large measuring glass or small bowl. Add to dry ingredients and mix with a rubber spatula or fork until almost completely absorbed. Knead dough in bowl with your hands just until a very shaggy, dry-yet-sticky dough forms. (It should hold together when squeezed; be careful not to overwork the dough.)",
      "Transfer dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet and form into a 12x9\" rectangle about 1\" thick. Using your hands, press down center of dough to about ½\" thick, leaving a 2\" border around edges. (This will help the shortcake bake into an even layer.) Chill, uncovered, in freezer at least 40 minutes and up to 1 hour.",

Scrape down sides of bowl, reduce speed to low, and slowly stream in 3 cups heavy cream. Gradually increasing speed to medium-high, beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. (Be careful not to over beat; you want soft, pillowy peaks—not stiff.)",

Spoon over whipped cream and drizzle juices on top. Decoratively scatter thin strips of lemon zest over if desired."

    "title": "Chocolate Magic Shell",
    "description": "When I was growing up in Australia during the ’90s, our version of Magic Shell was called Ice Magic, and it was all anyone under 12 wanted to eat. Name aside, the appeal was the same: When drizzled over ice cream, the chocolate sauce would instantly harden into a snappy shell you’d have to bust through with a spoon. Watching the velvety ripples solidify was thrilling.Though the store-bought options have nostalgia on their side, making a batch at home couldn’t be easier. Classic chocolate requires just three ingredients and comes together in the microwave in minutes. Like the commercial brands, coconut oil is the workhorse here. It’s solid at room temperature and liquid when heated, so it firms up as soon as it hits a freezing scoop of ice cream. Coconut oil also softens the chocolate just a bit, making it possible to break through the shell without a jackhammer. We opted for refined coconut oil, which has a neutral flavor. But if you love the taste of chocolate and coconut, the unrefined stuff works.Once you’ve nailed the classic version, channel your inner child and experiment with other flavors. Tahini and white chocolate is vanilla-y, nutty, and asking to be drizzled over strawberry ice cream. If you love Reese’s Pieces, combine peanut butter and chocolate, and pair it with coffee or caramel ice cream. While your chocolate shell is still setting, top it with crushed peanuts, sesame seeds, toasted coconut, or sprinkles.",

      "Drizzle over ice cream and let sit until a firm shell forms before enjoying.",

    "title": "Challah",
    "description": "This challah recipe is truly revelatory. It comes from former BA deputy editor Julia Kramer’s mom, Jill Weinberg. All we can hope is that our faithful version comes close. (For best results, bake weekly for several decades.) It’s “not airy and brioche-like, as are most ‘good’ challahs I’ve encountered in my life,” Julia explains. “And that’s why I love it. It has a density, such that when you pull it, it comes apart in twists and hunks—not feathery threads.”That density comes in part, she believes, from shortening—an ingredient that often replaces butter in Jewish baking, so pastries and breads can be served at kosher meat meals (milk and meat cannot mix according to kosher law). Challah is traditionally made for Jewish holidays like Shabbat and Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year), but this recipe it’s wonderful whether you’re celebrating or not. Don’t be tempted to swap the shortening for vegetable oil, which would render the bread greasy and leaden.A simple three-strand braid and an optional dusting of crunchy seeds add visual appeal. The recipe makes two golden brown braided loaves, but can easily be halved if preferred. The challah will keep, tightly wrapped, on the counter for three days or in the freezer for up to a month. Leftover challah is ideal for French toast and bread pudding.",

    "title": "Cherry Lemonade Beach Pie",
    "description": "A beach pie—like the kind popularized by Bill Smith at Crook’s Corner in Chapel Hill, North Carolina—should be very simple. To me the name indicates a dessert to make on vacation, in a rented house with limited kitchen tools at your disposal. This version, inspired by the cherry lemonade at Hot Dog on a Stick (the perfect summer mall drink, IMO), is made almost entirely with shelf-stable ingredients that you can throw in the back of your car for the drive to the shore; the only items that require refrigeration from the jump are eggs and butter.Don’t hesitate to make this recipe your own: You can use whatever crackers or cookies you want for the crust. I like saltines for their stiff structure that makes cutting clean slices a breeze, but the buttery crunch of Ritz with a tart, creamy lemon filling is great too. Just be sure to not skip the added salt; even an already salty cracker needs the bump once you add all that sugar and butter. And if cherries aren’t your thing, use a different jam and fruit. Strawberry jam with sliced strawberries around the edges, blackberry jam with plump blackberries dotting the surface—it’s all good.",

    "title": "Crunchwrap for a Crowd",
    "description": "The popularity of Taco Bell’s classic Crunchwrap Supreme needs no explanation. This breakfast crunchwrap recipe, inspired by the fast food chain’s own riff on the original, delivers the same promise of crispy, melty, and cheesy. But this isn’t a mere copycat recipe—our homemade version is blown up in size so that you can serve it in thick, pie-like wedges (which means no standing around making an individual DIY crunchwrap for each brunch guest).Each layer is thoughtfully constructed: Cornstarch and a glug of milk keep the scrambled eggs silky and never dry, American cheese provides the right amount of ooze and adhesion, while fresh Mexican-style chorizo effortlessly delivers a truckload of flavor.Look for thick taqueria-style tortilla chips, which hold their texture better than the wispy, thin alternative. And be sure to pick up burrito-size flour tortillas for easy folding and sturdy, evenly golden brown results. We love Mi Rancho’s tortillas (check out our editors’ blind taste test here).To make this vegetarian-friendly, substitute pre-baked crispy hash brown patties for the chorizo and check the label to ensure your refried beans don’t contain lard. Use just enough to cover the surface of the fluffy eggs before seasoning well, layering on the cheese, and assembling as below. Speaking of cheese, be sure to find real American cheese, avoiding anything labeled imitation, cheese food, or cheese product. If you can’t find good American cheese, use slices of cheddar cheese or pepper Jack instead. Serve your breakfast crunchwrap with a dollop of guacamole or a creamy jalapeño sauce.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Peanut Butter Cookies",
    "description": "You don’t need much to make a classic peanut butter cookie recipe. Many versions call for a minimalist approach (like Epicurious’s 3-Ingredient Peanut Butter Cookies). But, with a few tweaks, this already great cookie can be truly exceptional. Ours has a crunchy-chewy texture and a deep peanut-buttery flavor that’s not too sweet.Start by roasting the peanuts to wake up their flavor (yes, you’re roasting store-bought roasted peanuts). Meanwhile, brown the butter, which will enhance the cookies’ nuttiness. We prefer natural peanut butter here, so you can dial in the sugar and salt amounts precisely, and smooth peanut butter over crunchy to better control the cookies’ fat and moisture levels. Letting the cookie dough rest ensures the flour is fully hydrated, resulting in crisper edges and chewier middles. To finish, use a fork for a classic crisscross pattern or grab a cookie stamp or kitchen mallet for a different design.To bake them, we borrowed a bread-baking technique: Placing a pan of water in the oven creates a burst of steam, giving these peanut butter cookies a glazy, crispy, golden-brown crust, while maintaining their soft, delicate centers.",

    "title": "Spaghetti and Verrry Tender Meatballs",
    "description": "When I hear spaghetti and meatballs, I envision a lengthy (but rewarding) process of tending to both the meat and simmering sauce on the stovetop. But when a craving for this beloved Italian American classic hits on a weekday, I want it NOW, please and thank you. And thus, the creation of this weeknight-friendly version, entirely doable in just an hour. (Watch my development process—and all 65 attempts at nailing the meatballs—here.)On its surface, spaghetti and meatballs seems like a pretty straightforward dish—and it largely is. You have three parts to contend with: the meatballs, the sauce, and the pasta. The real star, for me, is the meatball component, which requires some love and attention in order to avoid the dreaded dried-out-puck fate.My ideal meatball is one that is fork—no, spoon!—tender. Many traditional meatball recipes include a trio of beef, pork, and veal to achieve this optimal texture; my aim was to pare this down to the more widely available (and affordable) beef and pork. A panade, a mixture of starch and liquid, is often added to meatballs for moisture; breadcrumbs (homemade or store-bought) or even Japanese panko can be used, but I opted for good old-fashioned Italian-style seasoned breadcrumbs, which produce a consistent texture and, of course, contribute built-in flavor. Additionally, I borrowed from the Korean playbook and include some grated onion and a touch of soy sauce for added umami. Whatever you do, use a light hand and DO NOT OVERMIX the mixture if you want tender meatballs. As for cooking the meatballs, I skipped the time-consuming oven and relied on the broiler to develop a bit of a crust, before finishing off the meatballs in the sauce.The tomato sauce is a supporting cast member here. I kept it simple with a marinara made from tomato passata, which always tastes brighter and fresher to me than tinned, though you certainly can use your preferred canned tomato purée, crushed tomato product, or even your favorite prepared bottled marinara (I always keep a jar of Rao’s nearby for just this reason). Feel free to add aromatics like basil, oregano, or thyme if you desire. I opted to keep the marinara canvas minimal here.Lastly, don’t forget to reserve some pasta cooking water (always!) to loosen the sauce. Unlike the emoji plate of spaghetti, it’s always nice to coat the noodles in a bit of the sauce before plating up; there’s plenty of sauce here to allow you to do this.",
    "ingredients": [
      "¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more",
      "5 garlic cloves, sliced",
      "4 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 2½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided, plus more",
      "2 24.5-oz. bottles tomato passata",
      "1 cup whole milk",
      "½ cup seasoned Italian breadcrumbs",
      "1 large egg",
      "⅓ cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving",

      "8 oz. ground pork",
      "1 lb. spaghetti"

    "steps": [
      "Heat ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil in a medium Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium. Add 5 garlic cloves, sliced; season with kosher salt. Cook, stirring, until fragrant (don’t let garlic brown), about 30 seconds. Add two 24.5-oz. bottles tomato passata. Add ½ cup water to one of the bottles, swirl around, and pour into pot. Give sauce a good stir and bring to a vigorous simmer. Reduce heat to low, partially cover, and simmer gently until sauce is slightly thickened, 15–20 minutes. Cover and keep warm.",
      "While the sauce is simmering, mix 1 cup whole milk and ½ cup seasoned Italian breadcrumbs in a medium bowl with a rubber spatula; let panade sit 10 minutes.",
      "Mix 1 large egg, ¹⁄3cup grated Parmesan, ¼ cup finely chopped parsley, 2 tsp. soy sauce, ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and ¼ tsp. freshly ground pepper in another medium bowl. Working over a large plate, grate ½ medium onion on the large holes of a box grater (you should have a generous ¼ cup). Mix grated onion and any onion juice from plate into egg mixture. Add panade and mix well.",
      "Using a rubber spatula, gently mix 1 lb. ground beef, 8 oz. ground pork, and 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt in a large bowl. Gently mix in egg mixture until incorporated; do not overwork. Using a #20 ice cream scoop (about 3 Tbsp.), portion out meatballs (you should have about 16) and place on an oiled rimmed baking sheet. Using oiled hands and working one at a time, pass meatballs back and forth between each hand (like a pitcher throwing a ball into his mitt, but lightly!) 5 or 6 times to remove excess air. The resulting balls should be smooth and shiny. Arrange meatballs in a 4x4 grid on baking sheet.",
      "Heat broiler. Broil meatballs just until golden brown on top, about 3 minutes (don’t be tempted to cook them longer; meatballs will finish cooking in sauce). Stir 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt into tomato sauce. Transfer meatballs and any juices to sauce, making sure meatballs are mostly submerged. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook just until meatballs are cooked through, 7–9 minutes. Taste and season with more salt and/or pepper if needed.",
      "Meanwhile, cook 1 lb. spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Return pasta to pot.",
      "Add a few ladlefuls of sauce to pasta; toss to combine. Tossing vigorously, add pasta cooking liquid a splash at a time until pasta is glossy and coated.",
      "Divide pasta among shallow bowls. Top with meatballs and sauce. Scatter more parsley and Parmesan over."

    "title": "Trinidad Corn Soup",
    "description": "In Trinidad, this hearty soup is most often consumed either while drinking, during one of those in-it-for-the-long-haul kind of nights, or the day after one of those aforementioned nights. Though the ingredient list is long, it’s a forgiving dish that doesn’t mind substitutions or missteps, so long as you don’t skimp on flavor.Green seasoning, made up of herbs such as parsley, culantro (or cilantro), thyme, and copious amounts of alliums like scallions and garlic, is a key base in Trinidadian cooking. My go-to bottle when I need it fast is Chief brand, but making it from scratch really is worth it. Bacon makes an accessible swap for more traditional pig tails or salted pork; however, corn soup is just as often made without any meat at all, which you can do here by substituting 2 Tbsp. coconut oil (or an oil of your choice) in place of the bacon fat. Leaning on peeled and precut squash will make quicker work of your prep as well. And while dumplings are a staple part of many Caribbean soups and stews, this dish is hearty enough on its own that I’ve made them optional. If you feel like adding them to your pot, it will only add about 15 minutes of time (and one extra ingredient: flour).While it can be made at any time of year with frozen corn, this soup really shines in high corn season when full cobs are available and the kernels are at their sweetest and juiciest. I can’t promise you it will cure your hangover, but it will certainly fill your belly.",

    "title": "Korean Potato Salad",
    "description": "Often served in a tidy scoop among the many banchan at a Korean restaurant, gamja salad is a sensory treat: cold and creamy, but with lots of crunch. It’s an excellent foil to Korean-style fried chicken, kalbi, bulgogi, and other Korean BBQ favorites.Among the many versions that exist around the globe (Japanese! German! Austrian!), Korean potato salad stands out for its sweetness, ranging from subtle to overt, courtesy of a pinch or more of granulated sugar, diced apple, or sweet raisins. But the inclusion of onion and cucumbers is essential for the crispness they bring. Hard-boiled eggs are also key—the egg yolks provide extra richness and while the egg whites give a bouncy bite. All together, the texture lies somewhere between chunky American potato salad and smooth mashed potatoes. It’s superbly refreshing served cold as an appetizer or side dish at a cookout, and just as tasty served right away, still faintly warm from the pot. Salting the onion, cucumbers, and carrot and letting them sit for a while is an important step that softens them just enough. Equally important is squeezing out the excess water the salting draws out. Squeeze as though you’re enraged—hard and thorough. The vegetables need to be rumpled, soft, and flexible before they’re folded into the potatoes.",

    "description": "Let us clear something up: Classic cream cheese frosting recipes like this one aren’t just for topping carrot cakes, cinnamon rolls, or red velvet cakes. Too often, this easy frosting is pigeon-holed, and we aim to change that here and now. Homemade cream cheese frosting can add a pleasantly sweet and tangy note to almost any cupcake or layer cake recipe, even one that calls for buttercream frosting—including this Double Banana Cake, which comes highly recommended (by us). In fact, this baker’s essential is so easy and versatile, it’s sure to become your new favorite frosting.This recipe requires almost no special equipment. A stand mixer with a paddle attachment works well, but a handheld mixer will also do fine. (If you go the second route, wrap a large dish towel into a ring shape around the base of a mixing bowl to help it stay in place.) Another bonus: The ingredient list is short and sweet. This is not a time to swap out full-fat cream cheese for a low-fat alternative or use anything but powdered sugar. Look for a confectioners’ sugar made with tapioca starch instead of cornstarch (check the ingredients). The tapioca does a better job of helping to thicken the frosting. And, if you prefer a tangier frosting, start by adding just 1⅓ cups powdered sugar, then taste the mixture before adding more. Even when the frosting looks fully mixed, keep on whipping to incorporate more air for the velvetiest texture.",

    "title": "Extra-Dry Martini",
    "description": "During the peak of the pandemic, millions of people—us included—found comfort in a martini glass. But even more so in an unexpected place: Stanley Tucci’s Instagram profile. A former bartender, Tucci shared negroni, margarita, and martini recipes. When it comes to the last one, Tucci has strong feelings about the many origin stories of the classic cocktail. “Too many people say too many things, and I wish they’d stop,” he says. “The only thing that matters is that the martini exists.”Here Tucci shares his ideal recipe that can be made into a gin martini or a vodka martini—there’s a time and place for both. Both are extra-dry martinis with just a whiff of vermouth and, of course, are stirred, not shaken. (For the record, James Bond was ordering a weak martini. Shaking a cocktail causes the ice cubes to chip, meaning they will melt and dilute the drink). It’s “the quintessence of elegance that we all aspire to and believe we acquire when we drink one,” Tucci adds. Finish it with lemon peel or green olives.London dry gin is the classic spirit used here, but feel free to play around with other styles if you like. For a dirty martini, add olive brine to the base before stirring and follow bar expert Al Culliton’s advice: “You can start with a few drops, but most lovers of this version would start at about a ½ teaspoon brine and work up. Call me conservative, but I like to cap it at ¼ oz.” You don’t want to distract entirely from the other flavors here.For more classic cocktail recipes like a manhattan, old-fashioned, and sidecar, check out our collection.",

    "title": "No-Brainer Corn Salad",
    "description": "Fresh corn salad is integral to summer. Pack it up for a potluck or serve it at a backyard BBQ or alongside fish tacos with a creamy hot sauce after a beach day—this classic summer side dish is always welcome at the table. You don’t even need several recipes on hand, just this highly adaptable one from former BA food editor Andy Baraghani.Consider this delicious salad a road map where you get to choose your own adventure. To play off the sweetness of the corn, you’ll want a splash of acid, like citrus juice or vinegar (rice vinegar, sherry vinegar, or apple cider vinegar all work here); a hit of heat from a serrano pepper, chili powder, crushed red pepper flakes, or black pepper; and salty bite from feta cheese, Cotija, or Parmesan. Plus, soft herbs like cilantro, mint, or fresh basil.Toasted nuts add extra texture, so start by roasting some to bring out their flavor. Once they’re in the oven, prepare your grill. You want to leave the husks on when grilling the corn so the kernels retain moisture but still take on some char. To avoid burning your fingers, let the ears cool slightly before slicing off the sweet corn kernels. (Reserve the shucked corncobs to make a summery broth).While this formula works well, you can take some liberties if you like: Add black beans or extra veggies like halved cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced red bell pepper, or diced red onions. There’s no need to refrigerate this grilled corn salad; it’s best at room temperature or still warm.",
    "ingredients": [
      "½ cup nuts (such as peanuts, hazelnuts, or pistachios)",
      "6 ears of corn, in husk",
      "1 serrano chile, thinly sliced, or 1 tsp. fresh ground black pepper or mild red pepper flakes",
      "1 cup herb leaves (such as cilantro, basil, or mint), torn if large",
      "⅓ cup fresh citrus juice or vinegar",
      "3 oz. cheese (such as Cotija, Parmesan, or feta)",
      "⅓ cup grapeseed or other neutral oil"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Preheat oven to 350°. Toast nuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 6–10 minutes, depending on the nut you choose. Let cool; coarsely chop.",
      "Prepare a grill for medium-high heat. Grill corn, turning occasionally, until husks are charred in most spots, 16–20 minutes. Transfer to a platter and let sit until cool enough to handle. Shuck corn and remove kernels (you should have about 6 cups).",
      "Toss nuts, corn, chile or pepper, herb, citrus juice or vinegar, and cheese in a large bowl to combine. Drizzle oil over and season with salt; toss again.\nEditor’s note: This recipe was first printed in our June 2019 issue as ‘No-Brainer Corn Salad’. Head this way for more of our best corn recipes →"

    "title": "Buttermilk Cornbread",
    "description": "There are a few schools of thought on what makes the perfect cornbread recipe. Purists argue the Southern classic should be made with cornmeal only—no wheat flour and definitely no sugar. Some say a portion of all-purpose flour is necessary for tenderness and structure; others argue that, for moist cornbread, a touch of sugar is vital and helps to bring out the sweet corn flavor. Maybe it’s ambitious, but we believe our best cornbread recipe (i.e., the one below) can satisfy all camps—and possibly teach us a thing or two about healthy compromise.This homemade cornbread recipe combines equal parts cornmeal and flour for a light, tender crumb. It’s got buttermilk for tangy flavor and a bit of sugar for subtle sweetness. If you’re not willing to budge on the “no sugar” stance, feel free to omit it—or if you’re a shameless sweet cornbread advocate, go wild and double it. For true Southern cornbread, skip the baking pan and use a preheated 10\" cast-iron skillet. Pouring the batter into a hot skillet, greased with melted butter or bacon drippings, jump-starts the development of a crispy, golden brown crust.This cornbread pairs spectacularly well with our ground beef chili recipe (or bean chili to keep it veg), but it’s also a spectacular side dish for fried chicken, barbecue, or any number of wintery soups and stews. Slice any leftovers into cubes to use in cornbread dressing, or toast them to make cornbread croutons.We have a feeling this easy cornbread recipe will be your new go-to, but in case you want more options, we’ve also got recipes for hot honey skillet cornbread, cornbread-cheddar cheese biscuits, and fresh cornbread muffins.",

    "title": "Easy-to-Love Chicken Thighs and Couscous",
    "description": "Does this look like summer on a platter or what? Everyone needs a back-pocket chicken recipe, and this pantry-friendly version lives up to its name. The vinegary marinade leans on spice-cabinet stalwarts to make a quick brine that delivers juicy meat with a sweet-and-tangy finish in just 15 minutes (even better if you have time for an overnight soak). You can get started on a simple seasonal Israeli couscous salad while the marinade does its thing. The grill takes care of both the corn and chicken here, but if you don't have access to a grill (or would like to enjoy this year-round), your trusty broiler can achieve the same char for both ingredients. However you cook the chicken, be sure to give the thighs some time to rest before slicing.",

    "title": "The Strawberriest Pavlova",
    "description": "Meringue desserts like pavlova can seem daunting, but meringue isn’t as fickle as you may believe. Some tips: Use a bone-dry bowl and whisk when whipping, and make sure you beat until stiff peaks form. Keeping the oven door closed while baking to maintain a consistent temperature is also key. You’ve got this! The result is a heavenly combination of soft and brittle textures where the outside has a shatteringly crisp shell, while the inside is a soft marshmallow cloud. Juicy, sweet strawberries are used in two different ways here to amplify their delicious flavors: They’re first used to make a silky luscious sauce, and they're also macerated and topped over the pavlova. (If you want to spread a layer of whipped cream over your meringue before adding the berries, we definitely won’t stop you.) Make the pavlova components a day ahead, or start it in the morning before heading to the beach; when you return the meringue should be completely cooled and ready to serve.This recipe is part of the 2023 Farmers Market Challenge, where we’re celebrating peak-season produce with five-ingredient recipes.

Only textured fries—like crinkle- or waffle-cut—will do. Their grooves and ridges turn exceptionally crisp in the fryer and expertly hold on to the spirited, salty seaweed seasoning and unapologetically garlicky mayonnaise.",

Morton kosher salt in a small bowl, crushing seaweed into small shards and rubbing bouillon into sugar and salt, until well combined. Stir ½ cup mayonnaise and 1 garlic clove, finely chopped, in another small bowl.",
      "Transfer fries to a large bowl. Drizzle with 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil (this will help the toppings adhere), then scatter seaweed mixture and remaining 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped, over. Toss to coat, adding up to 1 Tbsp. more oil if needed.",

Serve it all up with some toasted or grilled bread to soak up the delicious syrupy sauce.

Don’t worry, you still get the full messy, creamy, pickley eat-with-your-hands experience. While the chicken wings marinate in a spiced tomato paste mixture, you’ll quickly pickle a fresh trifecta of carrot, celery, and cauliflower to make an easy giardiniera.

Bright, herbaceous, and just spicy enough, the sauce comes together entirely in a blender and cooks in the residual heat from the pan, leaving its verdant color and bold flavors intact. A drizzle of cooling yogurt moderates the spice levels, though you could temper the heat further by removing the ribs and seeds from the jalapeño. And if you only have Greek yogurt around, just thin it with a little water or milk.I like using a toasted baguette for the sop job—the crustiness adds a nice crunch—but rice, couscous, or farro would be just as welcome.

    "title": "Pork Chops With Fiery Raspberry Chimichurri",
    "description": "A staple of Argentine cuisine, a classic chimichurri recipe usually includes a blend of fresh parsley, garlic, oregano, chiles, vinegar, and olive oil. It’s a bright green condiment with a chunky, herbaceous texture that adds a burst of flavor to any dish. This take on chimichurri involves mashing fresh raspberries—instead of garlic and herbs—to create a coarse texture and tart flavor that’s perfectly balanced with the heat from Calabrian chiles. Shallots, which get lightly pickled in lime juice and olive oil, add a sweet and pungent bite to the mix. This red raspberry chimichurri is an ode to summer, and it pairs wonderfully with grilled meats like pork chops, chicken thighs, or steak.This recipe is part of the 2023 Farmers Market Challenge, where we’re celebrating peak-season produce with five-ingredient recipes. Head right this way for the full collection.",

      "Mash 2 cups fresh raspberries (about 1 pint) in a small bowl with a fork until there are no large pieces left.

    "title": "Sour Cherry Crumb Cake",
    "description": "Whether you call it crumb cake or coffee cake or can’t actually talk because you already started eating it, there is just nothing better than a plush, buttery cake topped with crispy crumbly bits of goodness. Adding a jammy swirl of sweet-tart cherries to the batter results in a summery twist on an otherwise evergreen classic. If you can’t get your hands on fresh sour cherries, frozen will work; they’ll just need some extra time on the stove to get jammy. And if you can’t find sour cherries, you can use standard sweet cherries. You'll want to reduce the amount of sugar to ¼ cup and add the zest and juice of 1 lemon to the cooled cherry mixture before adding it to the baking pan.",

    "title": "Surprisingly Simple Sandwich Bread",
    "description": "Thanks to its high RPM (rotations per minute), a food processor can knock out bread dough in a mere fraction of the time it takes in a stand mixer. It’s shockingly speedy and surprisingly simple. The resulting loaf is soft and buttery, well suited for morning toast or afternoon sandwiches. Using cold butter and water is intentional––the machine generates enough heat to warm up the ingredients by the time the dough comes together. The recipe relies on a large-capacity food processor and its sturdy motor (we like the Cuisinart 14 Cup). Anything smaller than 12 cups can and will burn out.Take the time to press out and pop any large air bubbles as you shape the dough into a log. Air pockets trapped in the dough will continue to expand as the bread rises and appear as yawning gaps in the final loaf. A few pokes with a thin metal skewer as you roll the dough generally does the trick.",
    "ingredients": [
      "¼ cup (50 g) sugar",

Morton kosher salt, 2¼ tsp. instant yeast, and 1 cup cold water in food processor fitted with the metal blade until sugar and yeast are dissolved, about 2 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add 3 cups (375 g) bread flour and process until dough comes together and forms into a ball around the blade, about 1 minute.",
      "With the motor running, add 6 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, cut into ¼\" pieces, and process until butter is incorporated and dough forms into a ball around the blade again, about 2 minutes. (Properly mixed dough will be smooth, soft, and slightly stretchy; undermixed, it will feel sticky and easily break into soft clumps when pulled.) Turn dough out onto a surface and form into a smooth ball.",
      "Lightly oil a large bowl with vegetable oil. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a plate or lid and let dough rise at room temperature until puffy and nearly doubled in size, 2–3 hours.",

And she’s not alone in thinking that this is the ultimate fruit and nut combination. (If you want to extend the shelf life of your nuts, store them in the refrigerator.) While most salads need to be prepared right before serving, kale is a unique exception.

    "title": "Grilled Sweet Potatoes With Charred Scallion Mayo",
    "description": "A twist on traditional potato salad? Yes, please. One of Chef Tanya Holland’s favorite ways to serve sweet potatoes is by grilling them alongside green onions. She then blends the charred onions with mayo, lemon juice, and horseradish to create a dressing to spoon over the tender, smoky spuds. The best part is, you don’t need to peel or boil the potatoes: They go directly on the grill. To achieve the perfect grill marks, Holland recommends using a wire brush to clean your grill grates, ensuring an even cooking surface. And don’t walk too far away. Both the onions and potatoes have relatively short cook times so be ready to remove them as soon as they’re done cooking. (Using a combination of metal tongs and an easily maneuvered flipper makes that easy.)The heat of the grill concentrates the sugary sweetness of the orange roots while the combination of smoke and the savory tang of the dressing adds balance to keep things in check. The round sweet potato slices cook quickly and evenly on the grill, but if you wanted to cut the potatoes into wedges and serve the sauce on the side (to dip like elevated sweet potato fries), you certainly could. Any way you go, this sweet potato recipe is the perfect side dish for any backyard barbecue. Serve it with Sticky BBQ Chicken, pork chops, or short ribs—or make it the base for a main dish, piling on various toppings like you would nachos. Think refried beans, melty cheese, spicy green salsa, cilantro, and more.",

    "title": "Crispy Air Fryer Potato Wedges With Yogurt-Tahini Sauce",
    "description": "Looking for a side dish that’s crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and requires minimal work from you? This air fryer potatoes recipe delivers. Rather than turning the spud into french fries (which, honestly, you could just buy frozen), these air-fried potatoes are cut into thick wedges and tossed in a spicy, cajun seasoning–inspired spice blend before being air-fried until golden.We like russets here since their starchiness allows the exposed parts of the potato to crisp up, while transforming the insides of the wedges to puffy-soft potato—Yukon gold potatoes will also work. Soaking the wedges in cold water prevents them from sticking together and encourages even more crisp—but do dry them well before seasoning. The oil is essential here, so don’t skimp or sub in cooking spray unless you absolutely can’t help it.As for the spice mix, feel free to play around. Sub in store-bought taco seasoning, an Italian seasoning blend, or togarashi. Keep it basic with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Or garnish the cooked potatoes with shredded Parmesan and fresh herbs.To serve, you couldn’t do much better than this cooling creamy yogurt sauce mixed with lemon juice, sriracha, and tahini (we love Soom brand), but you could also make a sour-cream-based pickle dip or just load your plate with a big squirt of ketchup.No air-fryer?

    "title": "Strawberry Galette",
    "description": "One of our favorite ways to highlight ripe summer berries—second only to eating them out of hand—is to tuck fresh fruit into a flaky pie crust for an easy-breezy strawberry galette. But baking with strawberries is notoriously tricky, due to the fruit’s high moisture content and low level of pectin. To compensate, macerate fresh sliced strawberries in sugar to coax out their juices (avoid frozen strawberries here as they’d release too much liquid). You can discard most of the sweet syrup that results from the process—though we recommend saving it for another use, like cocktails. You’ll add a measured amount back to the strawberry filling, along with some cornstarch, to thicken it just enough to hold things together without any seepage.As for the galette crust, the tricks are much the same as in any pie dough: (1) use ice-cold ingredients, and (2) handle it as little as possible. A few tweaks here make things easier: First, freeze the butter and cream cheese (which keeps the crust tender) to buy yourself some time, and use very cold water. Second, chill the dough in the fridge for at least two hours so it has time to fully hydrate. And third, while you’ll want to roll the dough out to an even thickness on a lightly floured surface (we love a French rolling pin for this), don’t worry too much about its shape. A galette is meant to be free-form. Leave a 2\" border around the edges when filling the galette, then fold the edges around the fruit, brush with egg wash, and dust with a little extra sugar. If you’ve got raw sugar on hand, you can use it to add some crunch, but white sugar will do just fine. Top slices with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or freshly whipped cream.Want to play around? Feel free to swap up to half the fresh strawberries for another in-season gem. Try adding rhubarb in late spring, blueberries or raspberries at the height of summer, or sliced plums toward the end of summer.",

      "½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into ½\" pieces",
      "3 oz. cream cheese, cut into ½\" pieces",

      "2 cup (133 g) plus 1½ tsp. sugar",
      "1 lb. fresh strawberries, hulled, thinly sliced"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Place ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into ½\" pieces, and 3 oz. cream cheese, cut into ½\" pieces, in 2 separate small bowls and freeze 15 minutes.",
      "Pulse 1½ cups (188 g) all-purpose flour and ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a food processor just to combine. Add cream cheese and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add butter and pulse until pieces are no larger than the size of a pea. Remove top from food processor and evenly drizzle 2 tsp. apple cider vinegar and 2 Tbsp. ice water over flour mixture. Pulse until butter is in slightly smaller pieces and a small amount of dough pinched between your fingers holds together. (The dough will still look quite sandy and dry at this point. If it doesn’t hold together when pinched, add more ice water by the teaspoonful, pulsing a couple times after each addition, until it does.)",
      "Transfer dough to a large piece of plastic wrap. Knead dough with your knuckles and the heels of your hands, using plastic wrap to help bring it together, until most of it is in one piece. Shape dough into a rough 8\"-diameter disk, wrap in plastic, using your hands to work it into corners to eliminate any air bubbles. Chill at least 2 hours.",
      "Do ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled, or freeze in a resealable plastic freezer bag up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.",
      "Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 400°. Let dough sit at room temperature until slightly pliable, 5–10 minutes (this will prevent the dough from cracking as you roll it out). Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface, turning over and rotating often and dusting surface with more flour as needed, to a 13\" round. Carefully transfer dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet and chill while you prepare the filling.",
      "Using your fingers, rub zest of 1 lemon into ⅔ cup (133 g) sugar in a medium bowl until very fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add 1½ lb. fresh strawberries, hulled, thinly sliced, and gently toss with your hands to coat, taking care not to smash berries. Let sit until berries are very juicy, about 20 minutes.",
      "Drain berries, reserving 2 Tbsp. juice. Combine juice and 2 Tbsp. cornstarch in a small bowl and stir to dissolve cornstarch. Add to berries and gently stir to combine.",
      "If chilled dough is a little too stiff to easily fold, let sit at room temperature until pliable again, about 5 minutes. Mound berry mixture in center of dough, piling high in the center (it’ll level out as the galette bakes) and leaving a 2\" border. Fold edges of dough up and over fruit, pleating as you go and taking care not to tear (if it does, patch with scraps and pinch to seal). Lightly beat 1 large egg in a small bowl and brush over dough. Sprinkle remaining 1½ tsp. sugar over dough.",
      "Bake galette, rotating halfway through, until crust is deep\ngolden brown and juices are bubbling, 40–50 minutes. (It’s okay if some juices leak\nout.) Let galette cool at least 2 hours before serving.",
      "Top galette with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream to serve if desired.",
      "Do ahead: Galette can be baked 1 day ahead. Store loosely wrapped at room temperature."

    "title": "Classic Potato Salad",
    "description": "Author and educator Michael W. Twitty remembers a particular Juneteenth celebration—and this classic potato salad recipe—well. Ben Bynum, co-owner of South Jazz Kitchen in Philadelphia, made it for a backyard barbecue. Bynum’s easy recipe gives the old-fashioned side dish a sweet-meets-zingy profile courtesy of red onion, bell peppers, and a salad dressing reminiscent of the filling for deviled eggs.The type of potatoes you use—and how you cook them—is key. Yukon Golds are...well, the gold standard, but other waxy potatoes like fingerlings or red potatoes would work in a pinch. Steer clear of starchy russet potatoes, which would turn to mush. And don’t peel or dice them right away. Cut potatoes are great for roasting or frying, but when you boil potatoes, it’s better to leave them whole so they don’t soak in too much moisture. They’re ready when they’re fork-tender—much longer and you’re approaching mashed potato territory.If you have trouble finding sweet pickle relish, you can make your own by finely chopping a few bread-and-butter pickles and stirring in some of their juice—or you could make totally DIY pickle relish from scratch.This homemade potato salad is excellent served at room temperature with just a sprinkle of smoky barbecue seasoning or paprika to garnish. If you feel strongly about adding a touch of green, go with thinly sliced green onions or chives.",

    "description": "This recipe for mixed berry bars with a brown sugar crust was inspired by lemon curd and blueberry bars chef Tanya Holland found at a farmers market. She was particularly drawn to one farm that sold delicious blueberries, which she would often buy and eat by the handful. Here blueberries and blackberries are the stars of this recipe, but a combination of different berries can be used as well. These bars will satisfy your craving for a fruity dessert that’s both tart and sweet.

    "title": "Grilled Chicken Thighs With Sweet-and-Spicy Marinade",
    "description": "This simple grilled chicken thighs recipe gets powerful flavor from a Vietnamese-inspired marinade that hits all the right notes. Packed with fish sauce, brown sugar, and chiles the marinade is more paste than liquid, allowing it to cling to the meat and have a major impact in a short amount of time.The universal marinade will work with anything from shrimp to tofu to short ribs, but if you’re going with poultry, stick with skinless, boneless chicken thighs. Dark meat is juicy and has more flavor than chicken breasts, and while we usually favor skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs, this recipe was built with speed in mind. Using boneless meat reduces the cook time, but it also allows for more surface area so that the marinade can work its magic on the chicken more quickly.Use the downtime (as little as 10 minutes, but up to two hours) to start on a simple side dish like cookbook author Andrea Nguyen’s confetti broccoli and herb slaw with a tangy lime juice and sriracha dressing, or Ben Bynum’s silky, mustardy potato salad.You don’t need an instant-read thermometer here, but if you feel more comfortable using one, you’re looking for an internal temperature of 165° in the thickest part of the thigh.

    "title": "Grilled Party Salmon With Green Romesco",
    "description": "A whole side of salmon—an impressive centerpiece main for a crowd—is much easier to cook than it seems. Grilling the fish skin side down the entire time means no worrying about how you’ll flip a cut that big, and it keeps the grate clean. Once crisp, the skin provides a natural nonstick barrier making it a breeze to remove the fish from the grill. (The skin is also fun to eat and slides right off if you’re not a skin person). Additionally, with the right toppings and sides, salmon is just as great room temperature as it is hot from the grill, so you don’t have to rush to get everything to the table. A good timing guide for salmon grilled this way is 4—6 minutes per ½\" thickness at the thickest part; the 3-lb. sides I get at my fish market are usually between 2\" and 2½\" thick, which cooks in the time recommended below.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 Vegetable oil (for grilling)",
      "1–2 2¾–3-lb. whole skin-on side salmon",
      "1 Tbsp. plus ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for\ndrizzling",
      "3 Kosher salt",

    "steps": [
      "Prepare a grill for medium heat; lightly oil grate with vegetable oil. Pat one 2¾–3-lb. whole skin-on side salmon dry with paper towels, then place, skin side down, on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet. (You want to catch any excess oil when you brush the salmon, as it can cause flare-ups that will char the skin faster than the flesh can cook.) Carefully brush 1–2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, depending on the size of the fish (err on the side of less oil), over flesh side of fish; season generously with kosher salt.",
      "Place salmon on grate, skin side down, and cover. Grill,\nundisturbed, until skin is lightly charred and crisp and flesh is opaque, 20–23 minutes.\n(To check for doneness, slide a butter knife into the thickest part of the fish, pull it\nout, and hold a flat side to the back of your hand; it should be very warm). Using 2\nspatulas, slide fish onto a platter. Increase grill heat to medium-high.",
      "While the salmon is grilling, mix together 1 large jalapeño, ribs and seeds removed, finely chopped, 3 garlic cloves, finely grated, 1 cup coarsely chopped parsley, ¾ cup coarsely chopped unsalted roasted almonds, ¼ cup fresh lemon juice, ½ tsp. ground cumin, and ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil in a large bowl. Season almond mixture generously with salt and freshly ground pepper.",
      "Place 4 poblano chiles, halved, ribs and seeds removed, in a medium bowl and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil; turn to coat. Arrange, skin side down, on grate and cover. Grill until well charred, 8–10 minutes. Let peppers cool slightly.",
      "Drizzle cut sides of 1 lemon, halved, with extra-virgin olive oil. Grill, cut side down, until lightly charred, about 2 minutes.",
      "Rub off charred skin from chiles; discard. Coarsely chop\nflesh; stir into almond mixture; spoon romesco over salmon. Serve with lemon for\nsqueezing over."

In this recipe, yogurt is the backbone of a simple mixture (made with turmeric, onion, salt, and pepper) that takes just minutes to assemble and works magic on bone-in chicken thighs. Once grilled, the chicken is finished with a jolt of flavor thanks to lashings of chile-infused honey and a shower of tender herbs.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt",
      "1 tsp. freshly ground pepper",
      "1 tsp. ground turmeric",

    "title": "Sweet and Tangy Grilled Pork Tenderloin",
    "description": "For nights when you don’t want to spend more time cooking than absolutely necessary, this grilled pork tenderloin recipe is the answer. Finished with a tangy-sweet sauce made from the leftover marinade, it boasts a quick cook time and is easy enough to scale up if you’re having a crowd over for dinner (or love banking leftovers to eat throughout the week).Unlike pork loin, tenderloin is a lean cut of meat with no excess fat, so marinating it is the way to go. Pork likes sweet flavors such as maple syrup and brown sugar; here we pair it with a sauce of molasses, two types of mustard (yes, you need both), and apple cider vinegar to create what amounts to a mustard-based BBQ sauce. For even more flavor, you can dust in a little garlic powder, paprika, or cumin, or add a splash of soy sauce, but it’s just as delicious when kept simple.To check for doneness, use an instant-read thermometer (look for an internal temperature of 145°, meaning the center of the meat will still be a bit pink). While the pork rests, take advantage of the hot grill: Grilled corn on the cob would be a great side dish, as would a grilled sweet potato salad or any of our favorite BBQ sides.And when the next day rolls around, there’s no need to reheat: Pile the room-temperature leftover pork between two slices of bread, stirring any excess sauce into store-bought mayo (to spread on both sides of the sandwich, thank you very much).",

    "title": "Grilled Pork Chops With Soy Glaze",
    "description": "The secret to weeknight grilled pork chops? Soak thin cuts of meat in a punchy marinade, which only needs a few minutes to work its magic. Need more flexibility? The meat can hit the pork chop marinade up to 24 hours in advance so that you can prep ahead for any night of the week. No outdoor grill? You can sear the meat on a stovetop, using a grill pan set over medium-high heat.We prefer shoulder (a.k.a. blade) or rib chops for this preparation, which both have a little more fat than pork loin chops. Opting for bone-in chops will ensure the meat stays juicy, but because they’re sliced thin, the cook time will be the same as with any boneless pork chop. You don’t really need an instant-read thermometer here—as long as you follow the timing guide and remember that the best pork chops are still a little rosy in the center—but if you feel more comfortable using one, look for an internal temperature of 140°–145°, then let the meat rest for a few minutes before digging in.While you preheat the grill, prep some easy side dishes like grilled corn on the cob or grilled sweet potatoes with scallion mayo.

(Though this homemade coleslaw is also excellent with pulled pork sandwiches, hot dogs, and just about anything else you might enjoy at a backyard barbecue or potluck.)It’s packed with shredded cabbage and julienned carrots (for health!) and tossed in the holy triumvirate of coleslaw dressing ingredients: apple cider vinegar for acidity, honey for balance, and mayonnaise to tie it all together (feel free to substitute up to half the mayo for tangier Greek yogurt or sour cream for an even brighter punch).While many grocery stores sell bags of pre-shredded coleslaw mix and shredded carrots, they often sit on the shelf for too long and dry out, so do the work yourself if you have time. After you quarter and core the cabbage, you can thinly slice it with a knife, mandoline, or the slicing blade of a food processor. For the carrots, a box grater also works.Toss the cabbage mixture with the creamy dressing and pop everything into an airtight container and chill. Like many slaw recipes, this one’s best when allowed to sit for a bit.",

    "title": "Watermelon Cucumber Slushy",

In 1866, on the one-year anniversary of the announcement, Texas newspapers reported on celebratory whole-hog barbecues that Black Americans held. The journalists wrote with vivid details about seeded watermelon flanking the billowy smoke. This slushy is a celebration of bright red watermelon as a symbol of tradition. Summer doesn’t begin until a watermelon is cracked open. Here, it’s paired with equally refreshing and summer-abundant cucumber, a light tang of Champagne vinegar, and a lick of salt. This is a bright and balanced thirst quencher you’ll enjoy on Juneteenth and all of the hot days thereafter. For the smoothest slushy, please pound your ice to a crushed state before adding it to a high-powered blender; the end result should be spoonable, like soft ice cream.",

    "title": "Lemon-Pepper Catfish Nuggets With Peperoncini Dip",
    "description": "In the mid- to late-1990s, American Deli was a Friday night destination for college students of Atlanta University Center, the largest and oldest consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the US. Lemon-pepper chicken wings were rising in popularity and American Deli served them up straight out of the fryer and inexpensively. At the same time, for many Black Americans, the Friday fish fry was (and continues to be) a tradition that centers fresh catch and community. This recipe celebrates both of these popular culinary traditions, borrowing the flavors of one with the historic significance of another. Hunks of catfish get a buttermilk soak before being dredged in lemon-pepper-seasoned rice flour and cornmeal, making this dish both gluten-free and extra crispy. The golden nuggets get a final sprinkling of salted lemon pepper right after frying. Crunchy celery sticks and a creamy sauce featuring spicy peperoncini (and a bit of its brine) provide cooling relief. Take note: Some store-bought lemon-pepper seasonings have more salt and not enough citrus flavor; look for a seasoning with no added salt for this recipe so you have more seasoning control. These irresistible nuggets would be as welcome in your Friday happy hour rotation as they would at your next leisurely Juneteenth gathering. ",

    "title": "Vegan Chocolate Cake With Chocolate-Orange Frosting",
    "description": "This vegan cake recipe doubles down on the classic pairing of chocolate and orange, using the combination in both the crumb and the dairy-free buttercream frosting. It’s a simple dessert but feels fancy enough for a special occasion.While some vegan cake recipes call for applesauce, flax eggs, or aquafaba for moisture and lift, baking soda and vinegar provide the leavening here, so be sure to get the cake into the oven right after mixing, lest the reaction wears off. Regular ol’ vegetable oil adds the fat, but you could switch it out for melted, cooled coconut oil if preferred. Finally, the cake gets extra sweetness and tang from orange juice concentrate, opening up a world of possibilities: Trade it for passion fruit or lime concentrate, both of which work great with chocolate, to change the flavor.As for the ganache-like frosting: When this recipe was first published in 2010, Earth Balance was the best vegan option around. Today, you have a world of plant-based butters to choose from. Our favorite for vegan buttercream is Wildbrine, made with cashew cream and coconut oil, but whatever you like to keep around will work.Want to make a layer cake for a birthday party? The recipe doubles easily. Cupcakes? Yeah, you can portion the batter into a muffin tin (start checking for doneness at around 18 minutes). Need more vegan birthday cake ideas? This sophisticated vegan carrot cake is great for a small crowd, as is this vegan lemon cake with pistachios. For a larger group, you can’t go wrong with a chocolaty vegan cheesecake (that also happens to be gluten-free), but you can also veganize just about any non-vegan dessert with the right tools and ingredients.",

    "title": "A Giant Panna Cotta",
    "description": "What really is the purpose of portioning panna cotta into precious individual servings, as it so often is? Break free from the dainty molds, if you will. Instead, pour your panna cotta into a big bowl and bring it to the table in its full-size glory, quietly luxurious and begging to be dug into by the whole group at once. And while we’re at it, who said panna cotta has to be inverted before serving? That’s right, no one. (Okay, someone, but let’s put that aside for now.) Free from the pressures of having to somersault onto a serving plate, panna cotta can be less firm and rigid, more jiggly and wibbly-wobbly, trembling on the spoon like an unshed tear stuck on an eyelash.Gelatin is remarkably easy to use once you know a few ground rules. Always start by mixing it with a cold liquid. Let it hydrate and swell (or bloom, as it’s technically called) for at least 15 minutes before heating to dissolve. Underhydrated gelatin will be stubbornly gritty, never dissolving, and negatively impact the final set. As with all gelatin desserts, this will become firmer the longer it sits, so eat your panna cotta within 24 hours for the most delicate, elegant texture.Rather serve individual portions? Check out one of our favorite takes on the dessert with maraschino cherries and lemon by chef Ignacio Mattos.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Cheesecake",
    "description": "We won’t mince words. This is the best cheesecake recipe we’ve ever met. It’s wonderfully rich, flavored with a whole vanilla bean (plus a bit of lemon zest for brightness), and sports a buttery crust you can customize to your liking.According to former BA senior food editor Dawn Perry, using full-fat cream cheese, preferably Philadelphia brand, is critical for this New York–style cheesecake. While ricotta and mascarpone can be used to delicious effect for certain types of cheesecake, this isn’t the place for them. To ensure the filling is evenly mixed, the cream cheese, sour cream, and eggs must be room temperature before you start, so pull them out of the refrigerator at least 2 hours before combining. A food processor will deliver the smoothest batter since it incorporates less air than alternatives; if you don’t have one, combine the cheesecake ingredients with a stand mixer using the paddle attachment (or a hand mixer) on medium-low speed.Classic cheesecake recipes often get a graham cracker crust (which we fully support), but here we’ll grant you some leeway. Venture into your grocer’s cookie aisle to discover the many possibilities: Choose vanilla or chocolate wafers, gingersnaps, Oreos, shortbread, animal crackers, fortune cookies, or any cookie or cracker that looks good to you (Again, if you don’t have a food processor, crush the cookies in a zip-top bag using a rolling pin, or look for pre-ground graham cracker crumbs at the grocery store.) For an even crust, press the cookie mixture into the side of the pan before tamping down the base.Note that the oven temperature is lowered from 350° (for the crust) to 325° for the final bake. Baking the cheesecake at a low temperature means fussing with a hot water bath is unnecessary. You’ll know it’s done when the edges of the creamy cheesecake filling are set and the center has a slight jiggle. But don’t rush the cooling process: If your kitchen is very cold, leave the cheesecake in the turned-off oven with the oven door ajar to avoid thermal shock.The cake can hold in the refrigerator, loosely covered with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, for several days. No cracks should form, but if they do, top with hot fudge or caramel sauce, fruit compote, or whipped cream and fresh fruit, and no one will ever know.",
    "ingredients": [
      "9 oz. graham crackers, chocolate wafer cookies, vanilla wafer cookies, or gingersnap cookies",
      "1 Tbsp. raw sugar",
      "¼ tsp. kosher salt",
      "½ cup (1 stick; 4 oz.) unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled",
      "20 oz. cream cheese (2½ 8-oz. bars), room temperature",
      "¾ cup granulated sugar",
      "¼ tsp. kosher salt",
      "1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract",
      "⅔ cup sour cream, room temperature",
      "¼ tsp. finely grated lemon zest",
      "2 large eggs, room temperature"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Preheat oven to 350°. Pulse 9 oz. graham crackers, chocolate wafer cookies, vanilla wafer cookies, or gingersnap cookies, in the large bowl of a food processor until fine crumbs form (you should have about 2 cups). Add 1 Tbsp. raw sugar and ¼ tsp. kosher salt and pulse just to combine. Add ½ cup (4 oz.) melted butter and pulse until mixture is the consistency of wet sand.",

Scrape in the seeds from 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise (save pod for another use), or add 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract. Add ⅔ cup sour cream, room temperature and ¼ tsp. finely grated lemon zest and pulse until smooth. Add 2 large eggs, room temperature and pulse to combine. Scrape cheesecake batter into cooled crust and bake until edges are set but center is still wobbly, 35–40 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours.",

    "title": "Brown Sugar and Espresso Panna Cotta",
    "description": "Where some coffee desserts may whisper softly, this one trills like an opera singer hitting all the high notes. A full half cup of instant espresso powder will do that for you. Commit and you’ll be rewarded with something every shade of coffee fanatic—from the pour-over connoisseur to the blended-drink devotee—will enjoy. Remember that it’s instant espresso powder you seek, not instant coffee, which is altogether weaker and unable to stand up to the copious amounts of dairy in the panna cotta. Nor is it regular espresso powder, which won’t dissolve like you need it to.The brown sugar glaze is a thing of beauty, sleek and glossy as a glass building. Allow it to cool completely so it’s thick like honey, slowly drip-dripping down when you cut away a scoop of the panna cotta. Gelatin is remarkably easy to use once you know a few ground rules. Always start by mixing it with a cold liquid. Let it hydrate and swell (or bloom, as it’s technically called) for at least 15 minutes before heating to dissolve. Underhydrated gelatin will be stubbornly gritty, never dissolving, and negatively impact the final set. As with all gelatin desserts, this will become firmer the longer it sits, so eat your panna cotta within 24 hours for the most delicate, elegant texture.This large-format panna cotta is a crowd-pleaser waiting to happen, with zero individual ramekins involved.

    "title": "Boston Baked Beans",
    "description": "A pot of homemade baked beans will outshine canned versions 10 times out of 10, and this recipe for Boston-style baked beans turns out a side dish that’s rich, smoky, and complexly sweet. It’s also largely hands-off but does take a little planning.First: Please soak your beans overnight. We love canned beans as much as the next weeknight warrior, but starting with dried beans will give your baked beans the best texture and flavor. Navy beans are traditional, but we love creamy pintos. Second, skip bottled BBQ sauce and instead make your own out of a couple of standard pantry ingredients, but do feel free to take some liberties. Don’t have dry mustard? Swap in ½ cup Dijon mustard or yellow mustard. Want more depth? Add in about 1 tsp. smoked paprika and/or 1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce.Fat is essential here, and while bacon adds a welcome smoky flavor, it is possible to make a vegan baked beans recipe: Combine equal parts neutral oil and toasted sesame oil (about 2 Tbsp. each) for a nutty, savory flavor that won’t be overpowering, and just stir it in with the remaining ingredients.Cooking the beans in a Dutch oven means they can go straight from stovetop to oven, no separate baking dish required—but do bring them to a boil first to reduce the total cook time. The oven’s dry heat is crucial for intensifying the tangy-sweet flavors, and is essential for cooking the beans to a safe temperature. That said, if you have a slow cooker, you can use it to reheat the beans or to keep them warm during a cookout or potluck.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 lb. dried pinto beans (2¼ cups)",
      "8 oz. bacon (about 12 slices), cut into ½-inch pieces",

    "title": "Easiest Grilled Salmon",
    "description": "This side of grilled salmon is the ideal summer standby. It’s easy to make, super versatile, and it even tastes great cold the next day—so go ahead and make one even if you don’t have a big party planned this weekend.For the best grilled salmon, pay attention to the details: Wild salmon typically has less fat than farm-raised, so don’t skimp on the oil. Choosing a skin-on salmon fillet will make things easier to maneuver and prevent sticking. Set up your outdoor grill with two heat zones (one with medium-high heat and the other with no direct heat), and remember to scrape the grill grate well before brushing it with a neutral high-heat oil to prevent sticking. With a piece of salmon this large, it’s best not to bother with flipping. Cook it entirely skin side down, over indirect heat, both for ease and to develop deliciously crispy skin without overcooking. The flesh side won’t show any grill marks, but the texture and flavor more than make up for it. But do take advantage of that hot grill and throw some veggies over direct heat to serve alongside.Serve fresh off the grill with a big squeeze of lemon juice or let it cool to room temperature, paired with one or more sauces for drizzling. How about salsa verde or cilantro-loaded chimichurri? Or something creamy like aioli or a classic tartar sauce? Smoky romesco? Green romesco? Greener still pesto? The final garnish is totally up to you. Round out the meal with marinated zucchini (grilled instead of roasted), potato salad, or a simple green salad with a Dijon vinaigrette.For even more smoky flavor, try cedar plank salmon. Or, if you’re looking to grill smaller portions, check out crispy grilled salmon fillets with sesame and basil or soy-sauce-basted salmon collars.",

      "3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil plus more for brushing and drizzling",

    "steps": [
      "Build a medium-hot fire on 1 side of a charcoal grill, or preheat a gas grill (if using a 2-burner grill, light 1 burner on high; if using a 3-burner grill, leave center burner off and heat other 2 burners on high). Brush a rimless baking sheet with extra-virgin olive oil.",
      "Pat dry 1 4-pound wild salmon fillet, skin on, pin bones removed, with paper towels. Place salmon skin-side down on prepared baking sheet. Rub flesh side of salmon with 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil and season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
      "Brush grill rack with vegetable oil. Slide fish off baking sheet and onto grill rack over indirect heat. Cover and cook salmon until skin is lightly charred and flesh is opaque, about 20 minutes. ",
      "Editor’s note: To check for doneness, slide a butter knife into the thickest part of the fish, pull it out, and hold a flat side to the back of your hand; it should be very warm; you can also use an instant-read thermometer to check the internal temperature, which should read 140–145°.",
      "Holding baking sheet with oven mitts, slide under salmon; use another thin rimless baking sheet or a very large spatula to gently push fish onto first sheet. Transfer fish to a platter.

Here, we’re rethinking green tomatoes by combining them with peak summertime blackberries and blueberries (mulberries would also be great if you can get your hands on a pint or two) instead of dredging them in buttermilk, coating with cornmeal, and frying up—though that’s delicious, too, as is pickling them for a warm-weather sandwich.Pantry staple apple cider vinegar is the base for a dressing that features sumac, a tart spice commonly found in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern households—as well as in Indigenous American homes. The citrusy ingredient adds a perky touch, while a bit of vanilla extract rounds out the sharpness, providing warmth. Your tomatoes should be hard to the touch and on the smaller side, and I’d recommend making the salad a day before to draw out the best of the fruits’ sweetness and to let the flavors mingle. Serve this salad cold or at room temperature, and it works well to complement dishes like my Lemon-Pepper Catfish and picnic fried chicken.",

As it heats, the sauce caramelizes into a sticky, finger-licking glaze that pairs perfectly with smoky meat. These baby back ribs are ideal for fuss-free grilling as they can be cooked directly on the grill, with no need to bake or steam them first. If you are looking to cut down on time at the grill while entertaining, you could bake the ribs a day ahead and simply rewarm them on the grill. The sauce also pairs well with grilled chicken if that is more your vibe.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "1 Tbsp. herbes de Provence",
      "1 Tbsp. light brown sugar",
      "2 tsp. onion powder",
      "1 tsp. garlic powder",
      "2 racks baby back pork ribs (3–4 lb. total)",
      "1 Tbsp. vegetable oil, plus more for grill",
      "1 medium red onion, finely chopped",
      "4 garlic cloves, finely chopped",
      "1 cup fig jam",
      "½ cup apple cider vinegar",
      "½ cup spicy brown mustard",
      "¼ cup (packed) light brown sugar",
      "2 Tbsp. finely chopped canned chipotle chiles in adobo",
      "1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Mix 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1 Tbsp. herbes de Provence, 1 Tbsp. light brown sugar, 2 tsp. onion powder, and 1 tsp. garlic powder in a small bowl to combine.",
      "Place 2 racks baby back pork ribs (3–4 lb. total) on a rimmed baking sheet and pat dry. Remove silverskin from bone side of ribs (lift and loosen with a knife and it should pull away in a single sheet; removing allows spices to penetrate the meat better and avoids a tough texture) and discard. Sprinkle rub all over ribs; pat to adhere. Chill, uncovered, at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours.",
      "Do ahead: Spice rub can be made 1 month ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.",
      "Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high. Cook 1 medium red onion, finely chopped, stirring often, until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in 1 cup fig jam, ½ cup apple cider vinegar, ½ cup spicy brown mustard, ¼ cup (packed) light brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. finely chopped canned chipotle chiles in adobo, and 1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and carefully blend with an immersion blender until smooth. (Alternatively, you can use a standard blender, then transfer to a small bowl.) Taste glaze and season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper if needed.",
      "If using a grill: Prepare a grill for medium indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off). Lightly oil grate. Arrange ribs, meat side up, over indirect heat. Cover and grill ribs, turning and brushing with glaze occasionally once ribs are beginning to brown and become tender and replenishing charcoal as needed if using charcoal grill, until lacquered and lightly charred in spots and very tender, 2–2½ hours. Brush one more time with glaze, then transfer to a cutting board.",
      "If using an oven: Place racks in middle and upper third of oven; preheat to 350°. Place ribs, meat side up, on a clean rimmed baking sheet lined with a double layer of foil. Pour 1½ cups water into baking sheet, then cover tightly with foil. Bake on middle rack until meat is very tender and bones are exposed, 1½–2 hours.",
      "Heat broiler. Carefully uncover ribs and brush on both sides\nwith half of glaze. Broil ribs, meat side up, on upper rack until lacquered and lightly\ncharred in spots, about 4 minutes. Brush remaining glaze over, then transfer ribs to a\ncutting board.",
      "To serve, cut between bones to form individual riblets and arrange on a platter.",
      "Do ahead: Glaze can be made 3 days ahead. Let cool; cover and chill. Reheat before using."

    "title": "BA’s Best Banana Bread",
    "description": "There was a time in the BA test kitchen when everyone had their own go-to banana bread recipe. Then, after baking a bunch of loaves (14, to be exact), we aligned on this tender, ultra-moist banana bread as our collective favorite. Readers agree: With over 1,000 rave reviews, this easy recipe consistently produces bakery-quality results.What’s the key to the best banana bread? Details. Dark brown sugar has a higher molasses content than light brown, which helps the crumb stay soft and supple for days. Some banana bread recipes call for melted butter, which makes a dense, oily loaf; here we cream softened butter until light and fluffy, resulting in a plush, springy texture. A dollop of mascarpone gives the quick bread tang, but whole-milk Greek yogurt or sour cream work too. As for the bananas, go for very ripe, overripe, or nothing. Spotty, speckly bananas bring the boldest, sweetest banana flavor—so if the bunch is still green, let it hang on the countertop for a few more days.This recipe requires very little prep time, but a relatively long bake time, so plan ahead. A stand mixer makes the process smoother, but an electric hand mixer does the job. As for add-ins, chopped chocolate and walnuts are our ultimate combination, but this is your banana bread, so feel free to swap in dried cranberries or pecans. Or if you’re a purist, leave the banana mixture plain and sprinkle the top with raw or regular white sugar before baking for a crackly top.There are lots of other ways to mix it up too: For a heartier loaf, swap up to 25% of the AP flour for whole wheat flour, or for an easy on-the-go option, portion the batter into a muffin tin to make banana muffins (note that the cook time will be shorter, start checking at 30 minutes). But we like this banana bread best as is: Spread thick-cut slices with cream cheese or softened butter for serving. And if you have any left over, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or store in an airtight container.",

    "title": "Easiest-Ever Grilled Veggie Burgers",
    "description": "Our own Chris Morocco set an almost impossible task for himself: to create a from-scratch veggie burger recipe with patties that could go straight from the mixing bowl to the grill without falling apart. To make things even more challenging, Chris was aiming for vegan burger patties that would come together with a prep time of 20 minutes or less (about the same time it takes to make a beef burger) and with relatively few ingredients—bonus points if they were also gluten-free. A tall order. “There was a good chance this would be the mission that I simply never came back from,” he admits.Chris opted for an updated black bean burger patty, bulking it out with shredded tofu and quinoa, and adding garlic and chili powder for seasoning. The real key to success, however, was the mayonnaise (a vegan one is also great) and a surprise ingredient: almond butter. Combined, the two give the plant-based patties crucial richness. Meanwhile, flaxseed and cornstarch bind the burger mixture together. You can shape these homemade veggie burgers in advance, wrap the patties tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to three days or stash them in the freezer for three months (cook straight from frozen). If you don’t have a grill, a cast-iron pan set over medium-high heat on a stovetop will work fine and still deliver some crispy bites.Chris likes to serve the cooked burgers in store-bought buns stacked with the works, including chipotle yogurt—simply mix adobo sauce from canned chiles and Greek yogurt. Or, blend vegan mayo with sriracha and ketchup as an alternative. Best veggie burger ever? We’ll let you be the judge.",
    "ingredients": [

      "4 tsp. chili powder (make sure it’s salt-free)",

    "steps": [
      "Prepare a grill for medium-high, direct heat. Clean and oil grate. Shred 1 14-oz. block extra-firm tofu, drained using the large holes of a box grater. Firmly squeeze tofu in between paper towels to drain as much excess liquid as possible.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Caprese Salad",
    "description": "Real talk: Caprese salad (insalata caprese if you’re on Capri) is a dish to make when fresh tomatoes are at their peak; you should be able to smell them before you round the corner at your local farmers market. The time comes but once a year, so make the most of it. (If you’re reading this in the dead of winter, try a riff with roasted tomatoes instead.)Any combination of the summer beauties will work, but we like using a mix of heirloom tomatoes for this summer salad. Pick out a few larger ones like Brandywines, ideal for thick slices, and a pint of cherry tomatoes like wonderfully sweet Sun Golds. For the cheese, resist the temptation to buy burrata, which is too watery for this recipe. You want a simple ball of fresh mozzarella cheese (preferably made from buffalo’s milk) that you can tear into chunks.Toss the halved cherry tomatoes with oil and salt, and don’t be stingy with the seasoning. That salt will pull the juices from the tomatoes, which will mix with the oil and become your dressing. Again, resist the urge to add balsamic vinegar to the equation, which would overpower the flavor of the ripe tomatoes. Tap into your inner artist and lay your slices of tomato on a big serving platter, scatter the torn mozzarella ball all around, and spoon the juicy little guys over the whole shebang. Let it sit so the flavors meld (use the time to toss some Italian-dressing-basted chicken skewers on the grill). Just before serving, finish with freshly cracked black pepper, a drizzle more of your best olive oil, and some fresh basil leaves.This is part of BA’s Best, a collection of our essential recipes.",

      "Toss 1 pint mixed cherry tomatoes, preferably heirloom, halved with 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a small bowl; season with flaky sea salt.",
      "Arrange 2 pounds mixed medium and large tomatoes, preferably heirloom, cut into thin slices and/or wedges on a serving platter, slightly overlapping; season generously with flaky sea salt. Arrange 8 oz. buffalo mozzarella or mozzarella, room temperature, torn into pieces over tomatoes; lightly season mozzarella with flaky sea salt. Spoon cherry tomatoes over salad and drizzle with 6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil; season with coarsely ground black pepper. Let stand 30 minutes to let flavors meld and release juices from tomatoes and mozzarella.",

    "title": "BA’s Best Quiche Lorraine",
    "description": "Call it retro if you want—a good quiche Lorraine recipe is timeless. The French classic is buttery, bacon-y, and custardy, with a very tender, rich crust. And, while making one is a project, everything can be done ahead of time, so all you have to do before brunch is let it come to room temperature, make a green salad, and take the well-earned credit.The crust uses butter and lard for superior savory flavor, plus all those flaky layers that a store-bought pie shell simply can’t match. Be sure to use a deep-dish pie pan, as the filling will overflow a standard dish. We prefer metal for its ability to heat quickly and evenly, but glass or ceramic also works. We also like to place the pie dish on a sheet pan so that it’s easier to transfer in and out of the oven.If you’re baking this last-minute and don’t have any half-and-half, you can substitute with a mixture of heavy cream and milk in equal amounts; while Gruyère cheese is classic, feel free to swap in cheddar, Swiss cheese, or honestly, any combination of cheeses you have on hand, they’d all be delicious. No shallots? Reach into your stash of caramelized onions (you are keeping one, aren’t you?)You can blind-bake the crust a day or two in advance and leave it on the counter, or freeze it, well-wrapped, for up to 3 months. Beware of overcooking your quiche, as it will continue to set as it cools. Pull it out while the center is still a bit wobbly but the edges are firm.",

    "title": "Homemade Caesar Dressing",
    "description": "Whipping up homemade Caesar salad dressing is easier than you might think—maybe easier than running out to pick up a bottle of your favorite store-bought version. But first, you must embrace the anchovy. The salty little fishies provide the robust umami flavor key to the best Caesar salad recipes. Look for nicer ones in olive oil—bonus points if you use some of that oil in the dressing too.Second, don’t let raw egg yolks scare you off. They bring the creamy richness we associate with the Italian American staple, helping it cling to the romaine lettuce leaves with more vigor than any vinaigrette could. Buy the freshest eggs you can and stash the unused whites for a lazy-day meringue.For the best Caesar dressing—i.e., one that’s thick and lush—add the oil drop by drop, whisking until the base becomes glossy; then slowly stream in the rest of the oil, whisking vigorously until combined. Neutral vegetable oil works fine here (thanks again for the flavor, anchovies!), but if you want to swap all or some of it for extra-virgin olive oil, feel free. And fine, if you “just can’t” with the canned fish, swap in 2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce (which is what the original recipe was made with anyway).For the full Caesar experience, you’re gonna want some homemade croutons. For a chicken Caesar, try roasting the bird in Caesar dressing—it’s a game changer. You could also file this Caesar salad dressing recipe to use as a sauce for pasta salad, a spread for toast (topped with a fried egg or a slice of tomato), or as a dip for...well, everything.",

    "title": "Som Tum Thai (Green Papaya Salad)",
    "description": "With a balance of fiery chilies, sweet palm sugar, tangy lime juice, and pungent fish sauce, shredded papaya salad is a classic for a reason. It’s the ideal side for a summer cookout, but it also packs up well if you want to take it with you to a picnic at the beach or park.While the dish is a staple of Thai cuisine, it likely originated in Laos and came to Thailand via Isaan, a region in the northeast of the country. Today som tum (sometimes spelled som tam) is pounded in wood or clay mortars and pestles from Bangkok to small towns across the country. There are many variations, including ones with apple, cucumber, pineapple, and green mango. If this is your first time making green papaya salad, you might not know that, rather than a distinct variety, a green papaya is simply an unripe papaya. For the quickest prep, use a julienne peeler to whittle the fruit’s firm flesh into strips. Don’t have one? Use a julienne blade on a mandoline or simply slice the papaya into thin planks and then trim the planks into julienned slivers.Many of the ingredients in this recipe are easily found in larger supermarkets, but you could also head to your nearest Southeast Asian market to pick up the dried shrimp, long beans, and more. Online grocery stores, like Weee! can also deliver many of these items straight to your door.",

Sometimes referred to as a vegetable stew, it’s supremely adaptable. Out of zucchini? Yellow squash is fine. White or yellow onion? Either will do. Looking for a bit of heat? Add red pepper flakes. There are also Italian-leaning riffs made with pesto, balsamic vinegar, or pasta as a vegetarian main course.If it’s your first time making the Provençal classic, catch Andy Baraghani’s short video, or dive right in—there’s nothing complicated here. Start by salting the eggplant and zucchini to release some of their liquid and then brown them in batches on a stovetop over medium-high heat. Next, sauté the fresh thyme, peppers, and onions. Finally, put everything together, including the cherry tomatoes, and pop it in the oven. When it’s ready, finish the ratatouille with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and fresh basil or another fresh herb you like. Serve it as a side dish to grilled steak at a cookout, for breakfast with a jammy egg, or on good crusty bread for a snack. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator—they will hold for a few days.",

    "title": "Pollo Asado",
    "description": "The wafting aroma of pollo asado elicits “memories of walking from my grandparents’ house to the neighborhood fritanga stand,” says Giovanna Favilli, chef-owner of Casita Verde in Lakeland, Florida. “Fritangas are an integral part of Nicaragua’s food identity. At these food stalls, chicken, pork, and beef are marinated in naranja agria (sour orange) and barbecued to charred perfection.”Also called Seville or bitter oranges, the sour citrus gives pollo asado marinade its signature tang. You can find the fruit at some Mexican or other Latinx grocery stores, but equal parts fresh orange juice and lime juice can also stand in. The cut of chicken is less flexible. Don’t try subbing in skinless, boneless chicken thighs or breasts. Marinating a whole spatchcocked bone-in chicken delivers more flavor and ensures juicy chicken at the end. Achiote paste (made from annatto seeds and aromatics) gives this chicken its bright red color. It’s readily available in most supermarkets (and online), but if you spot achiote powder instead, it can be used as a substitute. Mix the powder with ground cumin, Mexican oregano, garlic, and a little extra sour orange juice to achieve a similar level of flavor.The real key to this pollo asado recipe is to lightly char the skin so it gets crispy, then continue cooking the bird on a cooler part of the grill. Use a meat thermometer to test the internal temperature—for cooked chicken, you’re looking for the thigh to register 165°. Use the cooking time to finish up side dishes like gallo pinto (rice and beans) and fried green or sweet plantains (a.k.a. tostones or maduritos).",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 3½–4 lb. whole chicken",
      "1 bunch culantro or cilantro, tough stems trimmed",
      "1 small onion, coarsely chopped",
      "2 garlic cloves",
      "2 chile congos or 1 habanero chile, stems removed",
      "1 cup naranja agria (sour orange juice), or ½ cup fresh orange juice plus ½ cup fresh lime juice",
      "2 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. achiote (annatto) paste",
      "1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Spatchcock 1 3½–4 lb. whole chicken by cutting along both sides of the backbone with kitchen shears or a sharp knife. Remove backbone (save for stock!) and turn chicken over on cutting board so it is resting breast side up. Press down on center of breast until you hear a crack (this will help the chicken lie flatter on the grill). Pat dry.",
      "Purée 1 bunch culantro or cilantro, tough stems trimmed, 1 small onion, coarsely chopped, 2 garlic cloves, 2 chile congos or 1 habanero chile, stems removed, 1 cup naranja agria (sour orange juice), or ½ cup fresh orange juice plus ½ cup fresh lime juice, 2 Tbsp. plus 1½ tsp. achiote (annatto) paste, and 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a blender until smooth. Place chicken in a resealable bag or large bowl and pour marinade over; turn to coat. Seal bag (or cover bowl) and chill at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.",
      "Prepare a grill for indirect medium-high heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill); rub vegetable oil on grate. Remove chicken from marinade, letting any excess marinade drip back into bag or container. Season chicken lightly with salt. Grill chicken, skin side up, over direct heat until lightly charred, about 5 minutes. Turn over and grill until skin is lightly charred, about 5 minutes. Turn skin side up and move to cooler part of grill. Cover and grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of thighs registers 165°, about 1 hour. (If the chicken has reached temperature but needs a bit more color, return to hotter part of grill and grill over direct heat until darker, checking every minute or so.) Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes before carving. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.\nEditor’s note: This recipe was first published in July 2021.

The main flavor of this dish is owed to Trinidad and Tobago’s Chief Hot & Spicy curry powder, made specifically for duck and goat. It’s stronger and hotter than your typical Madras curry powder, so it stands up to the assertive flavor of meat. You can purchase it online or doctor up Madras curry powder to use in its place: Combine 3 Tbsp. Madras curry powder, 1 Tbsp. ground coriander powder, 2 tsp. ground fennel seeds, and 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper.

The nutty sauce is inspired by Japanese goma (sesame seed) dressing, punctuated by zingy buttermilk. Even if your sesame seeds are labeled “toasted,” they can still benefit from another quick toast in a skillet to wake up their flavor—drawing out the deep aromas of the sesame seeds will really make or break this dressing. Lean on the pre-shredded coleslaw mix to save time and knife work. Best enjoyed cold, this hybrid is great on its own or paired with whatever you happen to pull off the grill. I love mini farfalle here, but your favorite small pasta will work fine; whatever shape you choose, I would recommend cooking the pasta until done (and not al dente), per the package instructions. ",

    "description": "The best strawberry milkshake starts with really good strawberry ice cream. Sure you could make it with vanilla ice cream—but why, when the strawberry is right there for the taking? And yes, while you could simply blend a few scoops with a little milk and call it a day, we say more is more. We pumped this diner-style shake with supersized strawberry flavor and vibrant color courtesy of homemade strawberry syrup and freeze-dried strawberries. It’s officially the strawberri-est drink you’ll ever sip.Gently cooking fresh berries into a syrup deepens their flavor—a technique that’s even more handy outside of peak strawberry season. You’ll have a little syrup left over for drizzling on pancakes or waffles or mixing with seltzer for a refreshing homemade soda. Meanwhile, adding in ground up freeze-dried berries, which are never heat treated, injects the mix with vibrant color and fresh strawberry flavor without needing to add more liquid. For the ultimate creamy texture, you’ll use a half-pint of ice cream per serving. We also opt for whole milk here, but it is entirely possible to go dairy-free, if you’d like: Just use coconut or almond milk in place of the dairy milk and cashew-milk-based ice cream for the base. Garnish with a swirl of nostalgic canned whipped cream, and a few fresh slices—or a dusting of crushed freeze-dried berries.If you’re looking for a less decadent option, consider this strawberry smoothie thickened with yogurt and bananas.

    "title": "Labneh",
    "description": "Straining yogurt overnight is a hands-off process that bestows two edible gifts: labneh—a thick spreadable yogurt with a supremely creamy texture that can be used as the base for a dip or slathered on a sandwich—and whey. Whey is slightly sweet with milky-tangy undertones that’s great in drinks (like this sharbat), dressings, or marinades. Using plain, full-fat yogurt will yield the best of each post-strain by-product, but if you’re in a hurry you can start with Greek yogurt, which has already been partially strained.Once you make labneh (which originated in the Levant region thousands of years ago) and have it stashed in your fridge, you’ll find out just how versatile it is: Spread it in the bottom of a shallow bowl and top with leftover roasted or grilled vegetables (see this blistered asparagus), then drizzle on a little extra-virgin olive oil plus harissa, za’atar, or sumac for an easy lunch. Blend in some fresh herbs, lemon zest, and lemon juice and serve with pita chips as a party starter. Pair it with baba ghanoush, muhammara, and/or hummus for a meze platter dinner. Or swap out the cream cheese in your favorite cheesecake recipe.Look for fine muslin cheesecloth, which will do better to separate the curds from the whey than an open-textured fabric. It’s a worthwhile investment as you can reuse it to strain homemade stock, big pitchers of iced tea, or a second batch of labneh while you’re busy using the first.",

      "Uncover yogurt and transfer to a another medium bowl; whisk until light and smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer to an airtight container and chill. Pour whey remaining in bowl into a 1-pint jar or airtight container (you should have about 1½ cups); cover and chill separately.",

    "description": "This striking sundae is inspired by a riff on the Eton mess we like at Runner Up in Brooklyn. The no-churn strawberry sorbet is plenty delicious on its own thanks to a good splash of Campari that imparts a hint of pleasant bitterness to the sweet sorbet. Adding a pillowy bed of tangy Greek yogurt whipped cream, crisp shards of vanilla meringue, and juicy berries turns it into a thrillingly unconventional sundae. Make the sorbet and meringue shards ahead so all you have to do when it’s time to serve is whip the cream and macerate the berries. ",

It stars in this riff on a traditional niçoise salad with blanched green beans, peppery radishes, and soft baby lettuces arranged in groups but begging to be tossed all together as soon as you pick up a fork. The zesty vinaigrette packs extra punch thanks to karashi, a nasal-clearing hot Japanese mustard that will perk up anyone after a long day in the sun. You can find prepared karashi in a tube (near wasabi), or as a dried powder version in a small can that you’re meant to reconstitute with water; if you have trouble, English mustard (like Colman’s) or Chinese mustard can sub in a pinch.",

This vegetarian entrée pairs perfectly with steamed rice and can be topped with store-bought crunchy fried onions to add an extra dimension of flavor and texture.

    "title": "Baked Alaska With Pistachio Brittle and Raspberry Curd",
    "description": "The origins of baked Alaska are a little murky. Some say the storied combination of cake and domed ice cream, insulated in toasted meringue, was invented in France. Others, New Orleans. And a different camp claims it originated at Delmonico’s in New York City. Provenance aside, it’s almost certain that the dessert was named in celebration of the Alaska Purchase in 1867 (yes, it’s been around that long). Making the seemingly incongruous hot-and-cold dessert from scratch is an undertaking, but with this streamlined recipe, you’ll deliver on the promise of a dramatic, high-impact showstopper without ripping your hair out.For our baked Alaska base, we opted for a quick and easy vanilla sponge cake that comes together in one bowl and less than five minutes. Next, we doctored store-bought ice cream (here’s our pick for best tub of vanilla), sprinkling in candied pistachios to make something that tastes extra-special without a lot of work. That said, you should feel free to change up the base and ice cream flavors to suit your mood; choose your favorite brownie recipe and chocolate ice cream for a darker take, or strawberry ice cream and pound cake for a distinctly summery version.One other element sets this baked Alaska recipe apart. With the egg whites doing their most, we just couldn’t let the yolks go to waste. We used them to make a raspberry curd that gets spread between the layers; when frozen it takes on sorbet-like consistency and adds a burst of bright flavor.You can use a broiler to toast the meringue, but after putting in the work, you owe it to yourself to pick up an inexpensive kitchen torch. That way you have complete control over just how toasted those glossy peaks get.",

Roasting your own beets will yield the brightest color soup (throw them into the oven in an aluminum foil pouch—you can roast them days before using them), but packaged precooked beets will work in a pinch. Homa Dashtaki, the author of cookbook Yogurt & Whey and founder of handcrafted yogurt company The White Moustache, prefers an immersion blender as it leaves some texture in the soup, but you can also use a standard blender.

Using paper towels, rub skins to remove, then coarsely chop beets. Transfer beets to a large bowl. Add 2 garlic cloves, crushed, ½ tsp. ground cumin, 3¼ cups plain whole-milk yogurt, and 1½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt. Using an immersion blender, blend until mixture is smooth and thick. (Alternatively, you can use a standard blender; just be careful not to overblend.) Taste and season with more salt if needed.",

    "title": "Vegan Street Tacos",
    "description": "Sure, cauliflower tacos and mushroom tacos are great. But, for those looking for an easy, one-step-and-done vegan alternative to meaty street tacos, you need little more than a pack of soy chorizo (a.k.a. soyrizo) and a stack of tortillas. Black beans add even more heft to this recipe for vegan street tacos, which incidentally are gluten-free, and come together in very little time. It's an ideal addition to any weeknight meal or taco party. Using store-bought vegetarian refried beans and corn tortillas means very little prep time is required. Let the soy chorizo brown on the stovetop like you would ground beef or cubes of tofu. Can’t find soyrizo? Grab a pack of plant-based meat and a can of chipotles in adobo and make your own plant-based street taco meat blend. And if your refried beans need a pick-me-up, add a pinch of ground cumin and cayenne or a chili powder blend as you heat the beans.To make a full meal out of these meatless street tacos, prep some pico de gallo, guacamole, and this cabbage slaw with a lime juice dressing from BA staff-favorite Lil’ Deb’s Oasis. You can also use the taco filling in burritos with a savory vegan cheese sauce or cashew cream.",

    "description": "These rolls, ostensibly a side, are front-and-center-of-the-table fare. Golden and glossy, gleaming with a brush of garlicky butter and dappled with dill, they simply won’t be ignored. Doubling down on the flavor agents with both fresh and dried versions of the garlic and dill proves that too much of a good thing is sometimes for the best, and these rich, eggy rolls handle it beautifully. Their soft and squishy nature is thanks in part to the inclusion of milk powder but mostly due to the use of tangzhong, a small portion of a cooked paste of sorts that keeps the rolls relentlessly springy and tender. For the loftiest rolls and most consistent results, use instant yeast and a digital scale to weigh your ingredients.",

    "title": "Fried Green Tomatoes",
    "description": "If your introduction to fried green tomatoes was the 1991 Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates movie by the same name, or even Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Café, the book on which the movie was based, you might imagine generations of home cooks across the South frying tangy, unripe tomato slices in cast-iron skillets.But according to Robert F. Moss, author of The Fried Green Tomato Swindle and Other Southern Culinary Adventures, the first printed accounts of ‘fried tomatoes’ showed up in Midwestern cookbooks in the 19th century. Green tomato variations followed in Midwestern and Northeastern newspapers before any mention can be traced to the Southern states. And while fried green tomatoes were most certainly made in Alabama and its neighbors long before the 1990s, the movie no doubt helped transform them into a regional icon.In this recipe from the now-shuttered Brown Bag Cafe in North Carolina, the more common cornmeal mixture is swapped out for crispy panko breadcrumbs, which makes the crust extra crunchy—perfect in a grilled pimento cheese sandwich or BLT or as a side dish to classic Southern recipes like buttermilk fried chicken. They’re also an excellent appetizer served with a spicy remoulade dipping sauce and make a great swap for the English muffins in a summery eggs Benedict.",

The gnocchi dough comes together easily by hand and requires no special tools or techniques for shaping, making this recipe foolproof for even the most novice of home cooks. It’s everything we love about handmade pasta with a fraction of the work.For chef Michelle Bernstein’s ricotta gnocchi recipe, you’ll boil and drain the pillowy dumplings, then bathe them in a creamy sauce punctuated with bright lemon zest and plenty of black pepper. You’ll find the method so easy, though, you may be tempted to make weeknight gnocchi a regular thing, pairing them with a summery fresh tomato sauce, classic Italian pesto, a brown butter and sage sauce, a simple shower of grated Parmesan cheese, or some other favorite sauce (we promise not to tell if that means jarred marinara).Interested in crispy gnocchi?

    "title": "Gingery Chicken Ramen",
    "description": "This easy recipe for satisfying, soul-warming chicken ramen soup gets a delightfully spicy kick from fresh ginger and jalapeños. Better still: It can be prepared in just 30 minutes. Searing the soy-and-honey-coated boneless chicken thighs leaves a deeply caramelized fond in the pan, upon which you’ll build the ramen broth. Store-bought chicken stock works here, but homemade stock is a worthy upgrade—excuse enough to save the bones of your next roast or rotisserie chicken.With minimal prep time and a pared-down ingredient list, this Japanese noodle soup is a breeze to make, perfect for sick days and busy weeknights. But if you want to take it up a notch, skip the instant ramen and even the store-bought fresh noodles and instead make your ramen noodles from scratch.As for the veg, yu choy can be found at most East Asian grocery stores, but you can substitute them for another tender green, like bok choy or mature spinach. Pair the ramen bowls with simply steamed miso-and-sesame-oil-dressed vegetables or serve as a stand-alone main however you’d like. Garnish with sriracha, cilantro, green onions, sesame seeds, or more veggies, like crispy shiitake mushrooms. But the jammy egg on top? Nonnegotiable.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

    "title": "Hot-Oil-Seared Biang Biang Noodles",
    "description": "Once a niche specialty of the Shaanxi province, biang biang noodles (or biang biang mian) have soared in popularity across China and the globe. That’s thanks, in part, to noodle shops like Xi’an Famous Foods in New York City, which introduced the broad hand-pulled noodles to hungry audiences. The restaurant’s cumin lamb noodles might get all the attention, but this oil-slicked, black vinegar-doused version is no less delicious. Adapted from the Biang Biang Noodles in Jason Wang’s cookbook, Xi’an Famous Foods, the simplified sauce of this noodle dish shows off the sinuous, serpentine beauty of hand-pulled noodles. No need for a stand mixer: These noodles are made entirely by hand (with the help of a rolling pin). Their name—biang biang—is an onomatopoeia of the distinctive twang they make as they’re smacked along the counter. For the best results, use a digital scale to weigh out the ingredients for the noodle dough. A properly hydrated, well-kneaded, and thoroughly rested dough will stretch easily. For all their drama, hand-pulled noodles need a steady, even gentle, touch. Tug the dough strands with even pressure on both ends to prevent tearing, allowing gravity to do most of the work.Dressing the cooked noodles with soy sauce and black vinegar, then drizzling with hot oil is the most classic way to serve biang biang noodles, but you can also pair the hand-pulled noodles with a slick, tingly Sichuan peppercorn sauce. After all that hand-pulling, you’re also free to finish them simply, with a sprinkle of scallions and a spoonful of chili crisp.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles. Check out all of the recipes—plus expert tips, handy guides, and more.",
    "ingredients": [
      "½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "3¼ cups (406 g) all-purpose flour",
      "1 Tbsp. (or more) vegetable oil",
      "8 Napa cabbage leaves, cut into 2\" pieces",
      "1 cup vegetable oil",
      "½ cup soy sauce",
      "¼ cup black (Chinkiang) vinegar",
      "1 Tbsp. sugar",
      "2 celery stalks, thinly sliced",
      "4 scallions, thinly sliced",
      "4 garlic cloves, finely grated",
      "¼ cup gochugaru (coarse Korean red pepper powder) or Aleppo-style pepper"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Stir ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt and ¾ cup plus 2 Tbsp. room-temperature water in a small bowl until salt is dissolved. Place 3¼ cups (406 g) all-purpose flour in a large bowl and drizzle salt water evenly over. Stir with a wooden spoon or chopsticks until shaggy clumps form. Knead firmly in bowl until a tight, mostly smooth dough forms, 8–10 minutes (there may be some dry bits but you should not have any large patches of dry flour). Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let sit 15 minutes.",
      "Turn dough out onto a surface and knead 1 minute (set a timer!). Cover and let rest 15 minutes. Repeat kneading and resting process two more times. By third kneading, dough should be noticeably softer and evenly smooth.",
      "Flatten dough into a 9x6\" rectangle, then cut into 6 strips (about 100 g each). Roll each strip into a ¼\"-thick rectangle (4\"–6\" long). Drizzle about 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a container that will hold all the strips when stacked on their sides. Place a dough strip into container and turn to coat on all sides evenly with a thin film of oil. Repeat with remaining strips, adding more oil as needed. Stack strips side by side (like books on a shelf) in container. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour.",
      "Working with 1 strip of dough at a time and keeping remaining dough covered with plastic wrap, flatten to 3\"–4\" wide and about 6\" long with the heel of your hand. Grasp each end of strip between a thumb and forefinger. Hold parallel to surface and gently pull slowly and evenly until shoulder-width long (allow gravity and natural stretch of dough to do most of the initial work). Continue to slowly pull dough, maintaining even tension on both sides and slapping gently against the counter to prevent the dough from tearing, until 38\"–44\" long. Using your thumb nail, puncture strip in the center and rip to separate, stopping before reaching ends of strip (you should have what looks like a very large noodle ring). If tabs of dough at ends of strip are too thick, press to flatten; set aside (no need to cover).",
      "Working with 2 or 3 noodles at a time, cook in a large pot of boiling water (do not salt) until al dente, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to a sieve and drain any excess water.",
      "Do ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Tightly wrap strips and chill. Bring to room temperature before stretching into noodles.",
      "Cook 8 Napa cabbage leaves, cut into 2\" pieces, in  reserved pot of boiling noodle water until wilted, about 45 seconds. Drain and transfer to a large bowl and add noodles.",
      "Heat 1 cup vegetable oil in a small saucepan over medium until very hot and starting to shimmer but not smoking, about 4 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, add ½ cup soy sauce, ¼ cup black (Chinkiang) vinegar, and 1 Tbsp. sugar to bowl with cabbage and noodles and toss to combine. Pile 2 celery stalks, thinly sliced, 4 scallions, thinly sliced, 4 garlic cloves, finely grated, and ¼ cup gochugaru (coarse Korean red pepper powder) or Aleppo-style pepper on top of noodles.",
      "Carefully drizzle hot oil over noodles, concentrating on aromatics to cook them lightly. Toss with tongs to coat noodles evenly.",

    "title": "Soothing Kake Udon",
    "description": "With simple, pared-back flavors, kake udon (udon noodle soup) tastes like the stillness of an early spring day: calm and soothing. This version from Namiko Hirasawa Chen, creator of the website Just One Cookbook, pairs an extra-easy broth with the undeniable star: chewy, bouncy homemade noodles. You can use dried udon noodles for this soup recipe, but making your own with this riotous foot-stepping technique—which makes the wheat flour dough softer and more pliable—is so much more fun. Be sure to rinse the cooked udon noodles under cold water to wash away excess starch and help them retain their bounce.If you expended all your effort making these Japanese noodles from scratch, rest easy knowing the broth comes together in a snap. While making your own dashi is not particularly difficult (all you’ll need is kombu and bonito flakes), dashi powder—which you can find at most East Asian markets or online—makes the endeavor even easier. Since the umami-charged soup base speeds things up, most of the prep time here is devoted to the homemade udon.A tangle of green onions and a dot of fiery shichimi togarashi are more than enough garnish, but Chen recommends halved cherry tomatoes, strips of cucumber, a soft-boiled egg, or a small dollop of yuzu kosho, should you want more options. Serve alongside steamed bok choy, sautéed shiitake mushrooms, and tempura veggies for a full Japanese dinner.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

      "Place bag with dough between 2 kitchen towels and place on the floor. Using your heels, step on dough to flatten into a thin disk (hold on to the counter so you don’t slip). Open bag and fold dough into quarters, like a piece of paper. Seal bag, pressing out air, and place back between kitchen towels. Step on dough until flat. Repeat process of folding and stepping 3 more times (5 total). The dough will feel noticeably softer at the end. Seal bag tightly and let dough rest at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours. (If storing longer than 2 hours, chill and bring to room temperature before using).",
      "Flatten dough on a surface to ½\" thick. Roll dough out to a 12x10\" rectangle about ⅛\" thick. For the most even noodles, trim the edges of the dough to make a neat rectangle.",
      "Lightly dust dough with potato starch or cornstarch and fold in half. Using a sharp knife or a bench scraper, cut dough into ⅛\"-wide noodles. Shake noodles to detangle, dusting with more potato starch as needed to prevent sticking (try to use less rather than more starch here).",
      "Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water (no need to salt) until al dente, 8–10 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold running water to remove excess starch and make noodles bouncy.",

    "title": "Three-Cup Chicken With Scissor-Cut Noodles",
    "description": "A staple of Taiwanese home cooking, three-cup chicken (san bei ji) is a punchy, sweet, weeknight-friendly dish usually eaten with white rice. Its name comes from the apparent ratio of its core ingredients: one cup of Shaoxing rice wine, one cup of soy sauce, and one cup of sesame oil—though few recipes actually use this exact combination. Our three-cup chicken recipe has a little more Chinese cooking wine and a little less sesame oil than most, resulting in a slightly sweeter, thicker, and more robust sauce that clings easily to its value-add starch: homemade scissor-cut noodles.If you’ve never made homemade noodles before, these simple scissor-cut ones are an approachable place to start. Don’t be afraid to adjust based on the feel of the dough: If it’s too dry, add a touch more water, and if it’s too sticky, add a touch more flour. By simply snipping the dough directly into boiling water, you get noodles with an adorable curled-in shape and satisfying chew. They’re an excellent companion to the saucy, aromatic chicken dish.As with most high-heat cooking, the process moves quickly—cut the meat into bite-size pieces (we opt for skinless, boneless chicken thighs, which are less hassle than skin-on, bone-in cuts), then coat with cornstarch and stir-fry in a quickly infused garlic and chile oil. A large skillet or wok both work here; just be sure to mix your sauce ahead of time so it’s ready to pour over the chicken pieces when the time is right. Use regular, not toasted, sesame oil here. Toasted sesame oil is intended for finishing; it will do in a pinch, but its nuttier flavor can turn acrid when cooked for too long. Add fresh basil (if you can find them, Thai basil leaves are ideal) to the pan in the last minute of cooking so they wilt just slightly.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

    "description": "What’s better than a fiery kimchi soup to warm up your insides? How about one loaded with chewy hand-torn noodles. This Spicy Kimchi Sujebi is a mash-up of two Korean favorites: kimchi jjigae and sujebi. While you can certainly find these dough flakes in a spicy broth, they’re often featured in a mild anchovy stock with zucchini and potato. This recipe includes a small bit of ground meat (beef, pork, or your choice), anchoring the soup’s flavor without being overly heavy. Making sujebi is easy, fun, and relatively fast—no special equipment required. Simply make the dough and let it rest while you prepare the remaining ingredients. As with all kimchi stews, the riper the kimchi, the richer the final soup will be. When preparing the sujebi, aim to create thin 1\"–2\"-long strands for the best chew. These sujebi noodles rely on a 50% flour-to-water hydration ratio for a great result, but they are endlessly forgiving even if you don’t have a scale.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

    "title": "Ultra-Chewy Scissor-Cut Noodles",
    "description": "Dried noodles are wonderful in all their many forms, but there’s nothing quite like the oomph and chew of a noodle made fresh by hand. In the United States, most people eat Asian handmade noodles at restaurants that specialize in them—most prominently at Chinese or Korean restaurants where you can see noodle masters at work, shaving off pieces with a knife or pulling dough with their hands. But it’s possible to get that satisfying texture at home too. And if you’re just starting to learn how to do it, you can employ an ultrasimple technique: using scissors to cut dough into noodles.Scissor-cut noodles, or jian dao mian, can be found in Shanxi, a northern province in China where wheat-based noodles in various forms are a staple. They’re a versatile noodle that can be used in soups or stir-fries or tossed with a hot oil-based dressing. The base dough is a simple mix of flour, water, and salt. (Read more about the magic of a 50% noodle hydration ratio.) Watch out for the texture when following this recipe: Add more water if the dough is feeling dry, more flour if it’s too wet. You need the resting time to let the dough hydrate properly, so don’t be tempted to skip that step.Once you cut the dough, you’ll get tiny, adorable noodles that curl into themselves like shells. If you’re not keen on cutting dough directly into simmering water, cut it into a bowl, then drop the noodles into boiling water. Either way, the final result will feature a pleasing chew that falls somewhere between an al dente pasta and a gummy bear.Use the noodles in the Three-Cup Chicken Scissor-Cut Noodles or Spicy Sausage Ragù or in any of your favorite noodle soup recipes, like this Tomato and Egg Drop Noodle Soup or a Classic Chicken Noodle Soup.

    "description": "These potato starch noodles from my book Tenderheart are incredibly versatile. They are similar in look and texture to loh shi fun, Chinese silver needle noodles (also called rat’s tail noodles in some Asian countries). They are known for their short, tapered shape, and are often steamed rather than boiled, as I have done here. Perfect for hot pot, soups, salads, or stir-fries, they are also good eaten simply under a fiery blanket of chili oil. It is their distinct chewy, bouncy texture which sets these noodles apart. They pair well with big flavors, particularly spice and heat: Try them in my Spiced Double Potato Noodles or Stir-Fried Curry Noodles With Eggs and Greens.An important note: You need to use potato starch for these noodles, not potato flour.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

    "ingredients": [
      "2 cups plus 2 Tbsp. (340 g) potato starch, plus more for kneading",
      "2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. vegetable oil"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Stir together 2 cups plus 2 Tbsp. (340 g) potato starch and 2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. vegetable oil in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Add ¾ cup plus 4 tsp. boiling water and stir to combine (mixture should look lumpy and a bit translucent). Cover with a lid or plate and let sit 5 minutes to steam (dough should be cool enough to handle at this point). Knead dough in bowl until it comes together. Scatter a surface with a little potato starch and turn out dough. Knead again until smooth and stretchable, about 5 minutes. Dough should feel smooth and neither dry nor sticky. If it feels dry and is cracking, add a little more boiling water. If it feels sticky, dust with more potato starch.",
      "Divide dough evenly into 2 pieces. Set 1 piece aside and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Break off ⅜\"–½\" pieces from remaining piece of dough and roll into smooth balls. Working one at a time, roll balls between your palms or on a clean surface (they shouldn’t stick) to make 2\"–3⅛\" long noodles (they should be thicker in the middle with tapered ends, but they don’t all have to be the same size). Place noodles on a surface lightly dusted with potato starch and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Repeat process with reserved dough.",
      "Cook noodles in a large pot of rapidly boiling salted water until they float to the surface, about 1 minute. Continue to cook until noodles swell, 3–4 minutes longer. (This will take longer if your water isn’t rapidly boiling so it’s important to maintain a high heat.) Using a large slotted spoon, transfer noodles to a bowl of ice water (they will turn translucent). Let sit in water until ready to use.",
      "Do ahead: Noodles can be cooked 3 hours ahead. Keep in ice water until ready to use."

    "title": "Bánh Cuốn With Pork, Shrimp, and Mushrooms",
    "description": "Originating in northern Vietnam, bánh cuốn (steamed rice rolls) are a hallmark of the country’s cuisine and a staple street food. In this version from Andrea Nguyen, author of Into the Vietnamese Kitchen, every element is homemade: The paper-thin rice sheets, the savory mushroom, shrimp, and pork filling, and the punchy, sweet-and-sour nước chấm dipping sauce. You can sub in store-bought rice paper for this bánh cuốn recipe, but making your own wrappers is absolutely worth it—and Nguyen’s smart skillet technique simplifies the process. Ladle the lightly fermented rice batter into a nonstick pan, spread into a thin layer in one quick motion, and cover with the lid to create the perfect environment for steaming. The batter may seem a bit loose, but trust the process; it’ll all come together. Once cooked, simply bang the inverted skillet against a prepared baking sheet (a sturdy cutting board will work too), fill, and roll, using a bench scraper to prevent breaking or tearing the delicate wrappers.Nguyen notes that the dipping sauce is typically used “to dress dishes that include unsalted ingredients like lettuce and fresh herbs, which need an extra flavor lift.” So serve the bánh cuốn with sliced cucumber, bean sprouts, and fresh herbs like cilantro, mint, or scallions, plus a side of chả lụa (ready-to-eat Vietnamese pork sausage).Vietnamese steamed rice rolls are at their best when freshly made, but they can be prepared in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Bring to room temperature and then reheat in a microwave oven just until they soften and are warmed through. The sauce can also be prepared early in the day and left at room temperature until serving.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

Squeeze out mushrooms over bowl, then finely chop; discard soaking liquid or save for another use.",
      "Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook ¼ cup finely chopped onion, stirring often, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add 4 oz. ground pork and cook, breaking up meat into small pieces with a wooden spoon, until browned in spots but still mostly pink, about 1 minute. Stir in wood ear and shiitake mushrooms and 4 oz. medium shrimp, peeled, deveined, cut into pea-size pieces, then add 1 tsp. fish sauce, ½ tsp. freshly ground pepper, and ¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt. Cook, stirring often, until pork is cooked through and shrimp is pink, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and let cool.",
      "Do Ahead: Filling can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.",
      "Whisk ⅓ cup fresh lime juice, 3 Tbsp. sugar, 1 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar (if using), and ⅔ cup lukewarm water in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Taste and add more lime juice, sugar, or vinegar as needed until sauce tastes balanced. Whisk in 5 Tbsp. fish sauce; taste and add up to 1 Tbsp. more fish sauce if needed to achieve a balance of sour, sweet, and salty. Stir in 2–3 green Thai or serrano chiles, depending on heat preference, thinly sliced, and 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped (if using).",
      "Place batter and a small bowl with some vegetable oil on one side of the stove. Spread out a kitchen towel on a nearby surface and place an inverted baking sheet on top. (Be sure to use a sturdy baking sheet—you will be banging the skillet against it.) Lightly brush baking sheet with oil. Place filling to one side of baking sheet.",
      "Heat an 8\"-diameter nonstick skillet over medium-low; brush lightly with oil. (The skillet is hot enough when a flick of batter sizzles gently on contact.) Give batter a good stir and ladle a scant ¼-cupful into skillet. Working quickly, swirl pan to coat bottom evenly. Cover and cook until crepe is translucent, bubbling (or even ballooning), and gently sizzling, about 1 minute. Uncover and cook until edges are pulling away from skillet and crepe is turning opaque but surface still looks wet, about 1 minute more. Invert crepe onto baking sheet, banging skillet to release. (Finished crepe should look like a mostly smooth white sheet.) Lift crepe to smooth out any wrinkles if needed.",
      "Working quickly (be sure to roll crepe while still a bit slippery), fold up bottom inch of crepe. Place 1 Tbsp. filling centered above folded edge and spread horizontally, leaving a 1\" border on both sides. Fold in sides of crepe to partially cover filling. Lift bottom edge of crepe up and over filling, then roll up and press lightly to seal. (Remember that imperfections are hidden once the crepe is rolled; hide ragged edges by folding them inward.) Transfer to a platter. Repeat with more oil and remaining batter and filling, adjusting heat as needed.",
      "Sprinkle ⅓ cup pork floss over rolls. Top with 2 Tbsp. finely chopped cilantro and ⅓ cup store-bought fried shallots. Drizzle some dipping sauce over; serve remaining dipping sauce alongside.",
      "Do Ahead: Dipping sauce can be made 8 hours ahead; cover and store at room temperature. Rolls can be assembled 2 days ahead; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature or reheat in the microwave in 10-second bursts just until warmed through before serving.",

    "title": "Meat-Lovers’ Miki Noodles",
    "description": "Chef Sheldon Simeon says this is the recipe that reminds him most of his late mother, Juanita Janet “Joanne” Moreno Simeon. A hearty chicken noodle soup colored with red annatto seed, miki was a homey staple from the Ilocos region of the Philippines that she usually cooked for Sheldon and his brother when they were under the weather. Even though the dish had noodles already in there, the boys would eat it with bowls of rice, just to soak up every last drop. Simeon still refers to miki as his ultimate “death row meal.”This is the deluxe version with smoked ham hock and a little bit of fresh shrimp. The hocks add a porky oomph to the soup, and you can use the shredded meat to garnish the noodles. What sets miki apart is that the noodles are often cooked in the broth until they’re soft and supple, which makes them give off their starch and thicken the luscious broth. What you end up with is a lot like chicken and dumplings. For this purpose, fresh noodles can’t be beat. Making your own miki noodles at home sounds intimidating, but for these very simple egg noodles, it’s incredibly straightforward: All you need are just a few ingredients and a rolling pin. The lye water helps to give the noodles a springy texture. Don’t worry about making your noodles look picture-perfect—rustic strands are part of the charm.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles. Check out all of the recipes—plus expert tips, handy guides, and more.",

    "title": "Homemade Udon Noodles",
    "description": "Refrigerated or frozen udon noodles are increasingly easy to find, but the delightfully chewy texture of homemade udon noodles is simply unbeatable. Namiko Hirasawa Chen, creator of the website Just One Cookbook, a boundless resource for Japanese home cooking, loves making udon noodles from scratch, and she’s here to show us how it’s done.Chen leans on the traditional technique of stepping on the firm udon dough (yes, with her foot) to quickly and efficiently work the gluten and knead the wheat flour dough into submission. Bare or socked feet are best so you can feel every delightful squish. (Don’t shudder, the dough ball is protected by a plastic bag.) Like Chen, we highly recommend a digital scale for mixing the dough.If you’ve been trained not to rinse noodles or pasta after cooking, take note: Rinsing these Japanese noodles under cold water does two things. (1) It washes off the excess starch, and (2) it shocks the cooked noodles after their hot water bath, snapping them into bouncy, chewy glory. Use your fresh udon noodles in Japanese recipes like kake udon (a simple, dashi-based udon noodle soup) or yaki udon (a stir-fried udon dish with ground pork and a mirin-soy sauce). Don’t be afraid to put your own spin on it, like in this bouncy, meatless twist on Italian carbonara. This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

    "ingredients": [
      "2 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. plus ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt",

    ],
    "steps": [
      "Stir 2 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. plus ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt into ¾ cup plus 2 Tbsp. (198 g) water in a small bowl until dissolved. Place 3¼ cups (406 g) all-purpose flour in a large bowl and drizzle salt water evenly over. Stir with a spoon or chopsticks until water is absorbed and shaggy clumps form. Knead dough firmly in bowl until a tight, mostly smooth dough forms, 8–10 minutes (there may be some dry bits but there shouldn’t be any large patches of dry flour). Form dough into a ball and place inside a 2-gal. resealable plastic bag (or, split dough in half and place each in a 1-gal. resealable plastic bag). Seal bag, pressing out excess air and let rest 30 minutes.",
      "Place bag with dough between 2 kitchen towels and place on the floor. Using your heels, step on dough to flatten into a thin disk (hold on to the counter so you don’t slip). Open bag and fold dough into quarters, like a piece of paper. Seal bag, pressing out air, and place back between kitchen towels. Step on dough until flat. Repeat process of folding and stepping 3 more times (5 total). The dough will feel noticeably softer at the end. Seal bag tightly and let dough rest at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours. (If storing longer than 2 hours, chill and bring to room temperature before using).",
      "Flatten dough on a surface to ½\" thick. Roll dough out to a 12x10\" rectangle about ⅛\" thick. For the most even noodles, trim the edges of the dough to make a neat rectangle.",
      "Lightly dust dough with potato starch or cornstarch and fold in half. Using a sharp knife or a bench scraper, cut dough into ⅛\"-wide noodles. Shake noodles to detangle, dusting with more potato starch as needed to prevent sticking (try to use less rather than more starch here).",
      "Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water (no need to salt) until al dente, 8–10 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold running water to remove excess starch and make noodles bouncy. Use immediately."

    "title": "Easy, Cheesy, Almost-Carbonara Udon",
    "description": "The love child of carbonara and cacio e pepe, this vegetarian take on the two Roman classics features deliciously chewy udon noodles in place of pasta, lots of frizzled onion, garlic, and a touch of soy sauce to compensate for the lack of meat. Egg yolks work their magic, resulting in a luscious creamy, dreamy sauce without a drop of cream in sight. I prefer the sharp flavors of Pecorino Romano and lots of freshly ground black pepper for this, but Parmesan and crushed red pepper flakes would be just as delicious. Go easy on the salt and taste toward the end; among the noodle cooking liquid, cheese, and soy there’s plenty going on already.Don’t be worried about the eggs scrambling—by bringing the pasta together in the skillet over low heat and allowing the warmth of the noodle cooking liquid to gently temper the eggs, the risk is reduced.

    "title": "Homemade Ramen Noodles",
    "description": "“Many people say that ramen is about the broth,” writes cookbook author Sonoko Sakai. “As a noodle maker, I say the noodles are just as important.” It tracks, then, that we’d go to an expert like Sakai for a lesson in making ramen noodles from scratch. That’s because even if there are plenty of great options for prepackaged dried, refrigerated, frozen, and even instant ramen noodles on the market today, they simply don’t compare to the fresh stuff. We’ll be honest: Homemade ramen noodles are a lot of work, and Sakai’s recipe requires some elbow grease (kneading by hand!) and special equipment (a pasta maker!), but don’t let that scare you off: It’s worth it, and we’re here to guide you every step of the way.Light yellow in color and springy in texture, this Japanese noodle’s signature bounce is typically achieved with kansui, an alkaline solution of potassium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate that regulates acidity, stiffening and pigmenting the dough. You can find bottled kansui water at Asian grocery stores, but Sakai uses baked baking soda, which can easily be made at home and has the same alkalinizing effect.While this homemade ramen recipe stops at the noodles, you have a lot of options for putting them to use. Make a creamy vegetarian tonkotsu-style ramen broth, a quick miso ramen soup with kimchi, or a gingery ramen noodle soup with chicken broth. Keep it plant-based with our Ultimate Vegan Ramen, seasoned with soy sauce, mirin, and sesame oil. Or build your own dream ramen bowl, topped with pork belly, steamed bok choy, scallions, sesame seeds, a soft-boiled egg, or all of the above. Or skip the soup in favor of a spicy chicken-and-ramen stir-fry. This noodle knows no bounds.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

Relying on just your hands, this recipe requires no special equipment and a few simple ingredients you likely already have. Grab a large bowl and get to work. This recipe outlines just the right proportions of flour to water to get you going (read more about the magic of a 50% noodle hydration ratio), but listen to your dough: If it’s feeling a bit wet, add a bit more flour; if it’s dry, add a bit more water (just a tablespoon of each at a time). Knead your dough and your daily stresses will melt away. The dough needs at least a 15-minute rest to guarantee that irresistible chew. When hand-tearing sujebi into your soup of choice (may I suggest Spicy Kimchi Sujebi), aim for thin, 1\"–2\"-long strands for the best textural result.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

(104 g) water, mixing with your hand like a claw until dough comes together and forms a ball (it will be shaggy and sticky; but don’t worry, it will get smoother when you knead it). If dough feels too dry, add more water, 1 Tbsp. at a time; if it feels too wet, add more flour, 1 Tbsp. at a time. Knead dough until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is taut with a smooth skin, 8–10 minutes. Wrap dough in plastic or place in a resealable plastic bag and close. Let rest at room temperature 15 minutes if using right away.",
      "To use dough in a soup: Unwrap and divide into 2 or 3 manageable pieces. Hold 1 piece of dough in your hand and stretch off a small piece with your other hand until thin and 1\"–2\"-long (the thickness doesn’t need to be perfectly consistent). Tear piece off and lay gently in a pot of simmering soup of your choice over medium-low heat. Continue with remaining dough, working as quickly as you can. Give sujebi a gentle stir and cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through (if you try one, there should be no floury taste), about 5 minutes.",

    "title": "Ultimate Vegan Ramen",
    "description": "Sure, you could make an easy vegan ramen using one of our favorite store-bought instant ramen packets—or you could make the best vegan ramen, i.e., this one, which celebrates fresh produce as much as the noodles. A true labor of love, this recipe from Sonoko Sakai, author of Japanese Home Cooking, is loaded with handmade noodles, lots of spring veg, and a flavorful broth so rich and delicious, we could drink it straight. Unlike some plant-based ramens that rely solely on miso paste for richness and depth, Sakai’s vegan ramen recipe builds a complex vegetable broth with layers of flavor from kombu, dried mushrooms, and a slew of aromatics, and gets a kick of umami from soy sauce, mirin, and sesame oil.And since you’re putting all that effort into the ramen broth—why not really go for it with the noodles? Even if you decide against homemade ramen noodles, skip the dried bricks from the supermarket. Instead, head to your nearest East Asian grocery store to pick up a pack of chewy, fresh ramen. Want to go gluten-free? Substitute the soy sauce for tamari and the wheat noodles for rice noodles or homemade potato noodles.This recipe calls for blanched seasonal spring vegetables like fava beans, snow peas, and asparagus, but you can also swap in crisp bean sprouts in the summer, steamed sweet potatoes in the fall, or bamboo shoots and baby bok choy in the dead of winter. Craving more protein? A soft-boiled egg pairs well and keeps this noodle soup vegetarian; to stay vegan-friendly, stick with the fried tofu (firm or extra-firm tofu work best here). If you like heat, keep the chili oil nearby; otherwise, garnish these vegan ramen noodle bowls with fresh cilantro and scallions and whatever other toppings you love.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

This version, developed by chef Sheldon Simeon, can be enjoyed in his Meat-Lovers’ Miki Noodles recipe or any soup or stir-fry recipe where miki noodles are called for.In soup applications, what sets miki apart is that the noodles are often cooked in the broth, thickening it with their starch. What you end up with is a lot like chicken and dumplings. For this purpose, fresh noodles can’t be beat. If using miki in stir-fries, you will want to parcook them before; simply boil them in water until nearly done before introducing them to the pan with other ingredients. Making your own noodles at home sounds intimidating, but for these very simple egg noodles, it’s incredibly straightforward: All you need are just a few ingredients and a rolling pin.

    "title": "Mushroom Stroganoff(ish)",
    "description": "Traditional mushroom stroganoff (itself a vegetarian take on meaty beef stroganoff) often relies on fresh thyme, white wine, and Dijon mustard for flavor. This recipe taps into your Asian pantry instead, with wonton noodles (store-bought or homemade), mirin, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and fish sauce (an excellent stand-in for regular stroganoff player, Worcestershire sauce). To drive home the mushroom flavor, we sidestepped the vegetable broth, instead relying on the umami power of dried mushrooms to make a robust gravy. Enriched with sour cream, the meatless stroganoff sauce coats the noodles with a glossy sheen. Using a mix of wild mushrooms like oyster, shiitake, or king trumpets will create the most dynamic dish, but if you can’t get your hands on these, any combination of criminis, portobellos, or white button mushrooms will do. As for the noodles, any chewy, medium-wide egg noodles work. Because the sauce is flour-free, you could even swap in gluten-free pasta. If you have a noodle-less pantry (and don’t wish to make homemade egg noodles), this weeknight dinner is customizable.

    "title": "Crispy Noodles With Coconut Shrimp",
    "description": "This recipe draws inspiration from the classic Hong Kong–style pan-fried noodle dish, which typically features a vegetable and seafood or meat stir-fry with sauce served over a bed of fried noodles. I love the resulting crispy-yet-soggy texture. In this recipe the noodles are coated in a delicious red curry coconut sauce that softens their edges while retaining their crispy centers. It’s the best of both worlds!When deep-frying a noodle nest, it is important to use a large enough pan and flip the noodles away from you to avoid hot oil splatters. Additionally, wiggling the noodles to separate any strands that are stuck together allows them to release moisture and fry evenly. By doing so, you can achieve crispy, perfectly fried noodles that are both golden and crunchy, with a deliciously satisfying flavor and texture. Lastly, feel free to mix and match your favorite vegetables and seafood to create your own unique stir-fry. Carrots, pea shoots, button mushrooms, and green beans are all great options to try.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

Here, I’ve introduced them to the intoxicating flavors of Singapore noodles; you can also enjoy them in my Spiced Double Potato Noodles.A good-quality curry powder is the key to achieving the familiar flavors of Singapore noodles. I only use S&B brand, which has heavy turmeric notes; it delivers punchy, powerful flavors to the neutral backdrop of noodles.This dish is gluten-free if you use tamari and is easily made vegan by omitting the eggs and including extra-firm tofu instead—use one 14-oz. package, cut into ¾\" cubes, and pan-fry until golden on all sides before adding to the noodle stir-fry.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

Place noodles on a surface lightly dusted with potato starch and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Repeat process with reserved dough.",
      "Cook noodles in a large pot of rapidly boiling salted water until they float to the surface, about 1 minute. Continue to cook until noodles swell, 3–4 minutes longer.

    "title": "Spiced Double Potato Noodles",
    "description": "Made of potato starch, these handmade noodles are very different from homemade wheat-based noodles, such as ramen and udon. Starches contain no gluten, so the raw dough is very supple. When cooked, the potato starch noodles become translucent, bouncy, and rewardingly chewy. They come together quickly—simply mix, knead, and roll. The short noodles are similar in look and texture to Chinese silver needle noodles—known for their short tapered shape (also called rat’s tail noodles in some Asian countries)—and which are often steamed rather than boiled, as I have done here. The stir-fry can be made with any type of large potato; cooked briefly over high heat, even starchy potatoes like russets won’t fall apart. If you’re looking for a shortcut, skip the homemade noodles and serve this potato stir-fry with store-bought sweet potato starch noodles or mung bean vermicelli for a similar stretchy noodle experience. An important note: You need to use potato starch for these noodles, not potato flour.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles.

    "description": "Deliriously fun to make, biang biang noodles are so called because of the thwacking sounds they emit as they’re gently slapped and stretched across the counter into ever increasing lengths. Typical of Western Chinese Shaanxi cooking, biang biang are a noodle that demand to be stretched by hand, their ragged edges and girth-y loops unable to be recreated by any machine. A minimum amount of salt in this biang biang recipe yields a more elastic dough. This recipe is adapted from the cookbook Xi’an Famous Foods by Jason Wang, named after the popular New York–based restaurant well-known for its hand-pulled noodles.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles. Check out all of the recipes—plus expert tips, handy guides, and more.",
    "ingredients": [
      "½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt",
      "3¼ cups (406 g) all-purpose flour",

    ],
    "steps": [
      "Stir ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt and ¾ cup plus 2 Tbsp. room-temperature water in a small bowl until salt is dissolved. Place 3¼ cups (406 g) all-purpose flour in a large bowl and drizzle salt water evenly over. Stir with a wooden spoon or chopsticks until shaggy clumps form. Knead firmly in bowl until a tight, mostly smooth dough forms, 8–10 minutes (there may be some dry bits but you should not have any large patches of dry flour). Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let sit 15 minutes.",
      "Turn dough out onto a surface and knead 1 minute (set a timer!). Cover and let rest 15 minutes. Repeat kneading and resting process two more times. By third kneading, dough should be noticeably softer and evenly smooth.",
      "Flatten dough into a 9x6\" rectangle, then cut into 6 strips (about 100 g each). Roll each strip into a ¼\"-thick rectangle (4\"–6\" long). Drizzle about 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a container that will hold all the strips when stacked on their sides. Place a dough strip into container and turn to coat on all sides evenly with a thin film of oil. Repeat with remaining strips, adding more oil as needed. Stack strips side by side (like books on a shelf) in container. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour.",
      "Working with 1 strip of dough at a time and keeping remaining dough covered with plastic wrap, flatten to 3\"–4\" wide and about 6\" long with the heel of your hand. Grasp each end of strip between a thumb and forefinger. Hold parallel to surface and gently pull slowly and evenly until shoulder-width long (allow gravity and natural stretch of dough to do most of the initial work). Continue to slowly pull dough, maintaining even tension on both sides and slapping gently against the counter to prevent the dough from tearing, until 38\"–44\" long. Using your thumb nail, puncture strip in the center and rip to separate, stopping before reaching ends of strip (you should have what looks like a very large noodle ring). If tabs of dough at ends of strip are too thick, press to flatten; set aside (no need to cover).",
      "Working with 2 or 3 noodles at a time, cook in a large pot of boiling water (do not salt) until al dente, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to a sieve and drain any excess water.",

This classic Vietnamese rice roll starts with a thin, crepe-like batter that gets steamed in a pan; the resulting noodle sheet is light with just the right amount of bounce. The rice roll's pleasantly chewy bite pairs well with flavorful meats and rich sauces (try this Bánh Cuốn with pork, shrimp, and mushrooms). For best results, use a nonstick pan.This recipe is part of Make Your Own Noodles. Check out all of the recipes—plus expert tips, handy guides, and more.",
    "ingredients": [

Whisk in 5 Tbsp. fish sauce; taste and add up to 1 Tbsp. more fish sauce if needed to achieve a balance of sour, sweet, and salty. Stir in 2–3 green Thai or serrano chiles, depending on heat preference, thinly sliced, and 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped (if using).",
      "Place batter and a small bowl with some vegetable oil on one side of stove. Spread out a kitchen towel on a nearby surface and place an inverted baking sheet on top. (Be sure to use a sturdy baking sheet—you will be banging the skillet against it.) Lightly brush baking sheet with oil.",
      "Heat an 8\"-diameter nonstick skillet over medium-low; brush lightly with oil. (The skillet is hot enough when a flick of batter sizzles gently on contact.) Give batter a good stir and ladle a scant ¼-cupful into skillet. Working quickly, swirl pan to coat bottom evenly. Cover and cook until crepe is translucent, bubbling (or even ballooning), and gently sizzling, about 1 minute. Uncover and cook until edges are pulling away from skillet and crepe is turning opaque but surface still looks wet, about 1 minute more. Invert crepe onto baking sheet, banging skillet to release. (Finished crepe should look like a mostly smooth white sheet.) Lift crepe to smooth out any wrinkles if needed.",
      "Working quickly (be sure to roll crepe while still a bit slippery), fold up bottom inch of crepe. Fold in the sides, then roll up crepe from the bottom and press lightly to seal (it should have the shape of a stubby 3½\"-long cigar). Remember that imperfections are hidden once the crepe is rolled; hide ragged edges by folding them inward. Transfer to a platter. Repeat with more oil and remaining batter, adjusting heat as needed.",
      "Sprinkle ⅓ cup pork floss over rolls. Top with 2 Tbsp. finely chopped cilantro and ⅓ cup store-bought fried shallots. Drizzle some dipping sauce over; serve remaining dipping sauce alongside.",
